## 📜 Lore Overview

This is the official archive for LucasDevil’s **YouTube horror universe**. After resisting one too many times, Lucas has lost full control. Death now uses this space to log timeline breaches, video corruption trails, and anomaly sightings.

Here you'll find:
- 🔥 Secret story elements tied to each video
- 🧠 Psychological breakdown logs
- 🕸️ The crossover between games and reality
- 🖼️ Corrupted thumbnail sketches and traces
- 📂 Notes from Death herself

## 🧩 Purpose

This repo serves two purposes:
1. **Backup and Lore Storage** — A record of everything related to the LucasDevil universe.
2. **Public Documentation** — For those who are curious enough to investigate what’s really going on behind the channel.

> This is NOT just a fan project.  
> This is a gateway.
