#### Description  
Standard Security Operatives form the backbone of D.I.V.I.D.E.’s containment and facility defense. They're the first line of response against breaches and internal threats, and the last thing an AT-Class subject sees if they run. Trained in anomaly-adjacent environments, SSOs are well aware that their job is dangerous — but not *important*.

#### Duties  
- Guard containment zones, labs, and restricted wings  
- Escort personnel, scientists, and AT-Class subjects  
- Neutralize threats until APA or higher-tier units arrive  
- Clean up after failed experiments (or *containment accidents*)

---

#### Equipment  
- Lightweight ballistic armor  
- Standard-issue anomaly-suppression firearm  
- Wrist-locked panic injectors (nerve-stabilizers or self-termination doses)

#### Common Internal Phrases  
> "We're not paid to ask questions — just to shoot if it screams."  
> "If you see something glowing, shoot it. If it laughs, run."  
> "Casualty rate? Comes with the coat."
