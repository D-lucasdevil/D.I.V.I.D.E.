**Overview**:  
LD-019 is not a singular object, but a structure — a retro bar/party house resembling a late-80s underground gambling den, originally discovered in [REDACTED], Poland. It has since appeared in multiple global locations, relocating itself after destruction or at random intervals. The building is indestructible by conventional or nuclear means, as it reconstructs itself elsewhere within 7-10 days of destruction.  

**Behavior**:  
LD-019 operates as a high-risk gambling venue where participants can engage in a life-or-death game known as “Buckshot Roulette.” For a buy-in of $50,000 to $65,000 USD, participants play a deadly variation of Russian Roulette using a non-anomalous shotgun.  

The winner is awarded the shotgun and the full cash pool.  
Alcohol, music, and entertainment are freely available — but still cost real money.  

Participants willingly enter the game; LD-019 does not force or compel anyone. If the building is left empty or unsupervised, it resets its interior to its default pristine state instantly.  

**The Dealer**:  
A entity known only as "The Dealer" oversees every game. Its face is permanently obscured, and attempts to record, harm, or interact outside of gameplay have all failed. The Dealer is confined to the interior of LD-019 and does not wish to leave.  

Reports suggest it once killed a god—a claim supported by a document signed GOD and readings of a god like being all tho a lower god. Analysis confirms this was not from LD-000 or LD-00-1.  

**Channel CR**:  
All games held inside LD-019 are broadcast live on a mysterious television channel known as CR.  

The channel cannot be shut down, jammed, or erased.  

It appears on every television or livestream-capable device without warning.  

The signal cannot be traced.  

Commentators speculate the Dealer itself controls the signal.  

**Threat Assessment**:  
Despite its fatal potential, LD-019 is not hostile. Its threat is conditional — participants must choose to engage.  
It is considered Class 2 due to its regenerative nature and global influence but poses no risk unless interacted with directly.  

**Note from Polish Authorities**:  

“Just because you can win $65,000 doesn’t mean you should.”  

**Directive**:  

“LD-019 is to be monitored, but not contained. Let the fools gamble their lives.”
