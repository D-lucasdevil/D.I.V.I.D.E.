**File: LD-014 — “The Knife That Loves Too Deeply”**  
**Designation**: Sentient Object / Cursed Weapon  
**Threat Level**: Class III (Escalating / Psychological Risk)  
**Containment Status**: Secured Containment Vault (Sub-Level 6)  
**Clearance Level**: DIVIDE Level 3+  





**Description**:  
LD-014 is an ornate, violet-hued ceremonial dagger of unknown origin. Despite intensive analysis, it has proven utterly indestructible. Material composition is unidentifiable. The blade is capable of slicing through any known substance, including Class IV anomalies such as LD-013 (“Insect Matron”).  

When wielded, the knife exhibits cognitohazardous effects that intensify with each use. The wielder begins to experience compulsions to self-harm, escalating in severity after every strike:  

Stage 1: Small, seemingly voluntary incisions on arms or hands  

Stage 2: Deeper cuts, loss of control over movement  

Stage 3: Removal of skin, muscle tissue, or digits  

Stage 4: Self-evisceration with euphoria  

Stage 5: Total self-destruction — subjects cut out vital organs while conscious, often smiling or speaking to an unseen presence  

Victims report a sensation of “being loved” or “understood completely” while using the knife. Some refer to the blade as “her.”  

**Containment Protocol**:  
LD-014 is held in a triple-sealed containment case lined with electromagnetic dampeners and psychological suppression fields. Interaction is strictly forbidden unless approved for testing by DIVIDE Level 4+ researchers.  

All personnel within 5 meters of LD-014 must be psychologically screened before and after exposure. It can be used as offensive weapon but limited to 1 use per person or only by AT-class fitted with remote torchure device if not complient.  

Any personnel exhibiting obsessive behavior toward LD-014 are to be quarantined and amnesticized.  

**Internal Note**:  
“It's not the knife that's dangerous. It's how she makes you feel while you die.”
