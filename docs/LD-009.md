**File: LD-009 — “The Endless Lift”**   
**Designation**: Dimensional Anchorpoint / Mobile Spatial Gateway
**Threat Level**: Class II
**Containment Status**: Relocated / Sealed Access
**Clearance Level**: DIVIDE Level 3+ Required for Activation

**Description**     
LD-009 is a rusted, outdated elevator of unknown origin discovered in an unmarked region far outside populated zones. The structure was free-standing, with no attached building or foundation. The interior appears normal but functions as a dimensional transit system, offering access to an unknown number of alternate floors—each serving as a self-contained reality or containment space.

Once entered, the elevator closes and begins cycling through floors autonomously. There are no mechanical buttons inside. The anomaly is not limited by traditional physics or floor count. Escape is statistically improbable.

**Recorded survival rate**:   
☑️ 1 in 118,469 AT-Class test subjects have successfully exited.

The lone known survivor, AT-███-4519, refused to disclose the full nature of the elevator’s internals—even under duress. His only statement:

“Don’t send anyone in there. They don’t have a chance.”

**Recorded Floor Reports (From AT-███-4519 testimony)**   
Floor ██: A pitch-black chamber. When illuminated, revealed to be a gigantic biological mouth. Any personnel entering were immediately consumed.

Floor ██: A sealed industrial chamber filled with radioactive waste. Fatal within seconds without gear. Subject narrowly escaped.

Floor ██: A pristine white room containing only a suspended black gravitational anomaly. Victims were violently pulled inside upon entry.

Floor 4: A lone locked door. No markings. No response. Subject moved on.

Floor ██: A vast, endless cubicle space, populated with dozens of surviving AT-Class subjects. They subsist on self-replenishing water and nutrient packs. No exit has been located.

Floor ██: A butcher’s room, drenched in blood. Subject extracted a key from a body strung on meat hooks.

Floor ██: A hostile encampment of worn, half-mad AT-Class survivors. They attempted to kill the subject to take his place in the elevator. He retaliated, maiming two, and escaped.

Floor ██: [REDACTED]. The entire chamber existed mid-air, with no visible walls or supports. [REDACTED] may have been present, though confirmation is pending.

The total number of unique floors is unknown. Some appear sentient or reactive to the subject’s mental state.

**Behavioral Traits**   
Autonomous floor generation with randomization

Each floor contains unique threats, rules, and spatial laws


Hostile and passive zones both exist

Exit chance: Extremely low

Elevator cannot be opened to save said AT-class a new clean and empty elevator will show for another subject

Once inside, you must complete a cycle to escape

**Containment Protocol**   
LD-009 has been relocated to DIVIDE Sector-07, sealed in a 10-meter reinforced chamber monitored 24/7. It is to remain sealed off unless specifically authorized by a Level 3+ researcher.

Under no circumstances are personnel allowed to enter without clearance and real-time biometric monitoring. All expeditions must consist of AT-Class subjects with biometric tags and remote kill switches.

Any breach or reappearance of floors in the real world is to be considered a full S-class priority containment breach.

**Internal Note**   
“It’s not a machine. It’s a test.”

“The elevator doesn’t go down. It goes in.”
