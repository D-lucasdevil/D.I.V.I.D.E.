“Image captured under thermal-controlled lighting in secured containment.”  

**Description**  
LD-023 appears as an unassuming, slightly scorched matchbox made of darkened oak and aged paper wrapping. Despite frequent use, it shows no degradation. Inside, the box always contains a full set of wooden matches. Matches regenerate within seconds after one is removed or used, effectively creating an infinite supply.  

When a match is struck, it will ignite flawlessly regardless of conditions (e.g., wind, water exposure, vacuum environments). The flame will burn continuously until:  

The user mentally commands it to extinguish  

The match is thrown and naturally snuffed (e.g., lands in water or breaks apart)  

LD-023 exhibits advanced fire-manipulative effects. The user may set any flammable object ablaze and mentally dictate the boundaries and behavior of the fire, such as preventing it from spreading past a doorway or allowing it to follow a specific shape.  

The user is completely immune to any flame originating from LD-023 for up to one hour after the last match was ignited. Once this hour passes, normal vulnerability returns.  

**Behavioral Effects**  
Infinite match generation, with instant regeneration after use  

Matches always ignite upon striking  

Flame can be psychically controlled in spread and intensity  

User immune to created fire for 60 minutes after activation  

Fire cannot be stopped by conventional methods unless extinguished intentionally by user or through natural dissipation  

Matches exhibit normal burn time unless influenced by the user  

**Containment Protocol**  
LD-023 is stored in a flame-retardant case inside a triple-sealed fireproof locker  

Handling only permitted with thermal-insulated gloves and under supervision  

Testing restricted to designated fireproof labs  

All use must be recorded and logged; cooldown period of 24 hours between uses  

Emergency extinguishing systems must be on standby during any testing  

**Internal Note**  
“Control fire, or it controls you — this box just gives you the illusion of safety.”
