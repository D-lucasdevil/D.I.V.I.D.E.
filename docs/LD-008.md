**Description**  
LD-008, referred to internally as “Laughtrack,” is a humanoid animatronic clown of unknown origin, discovered standing upright and powered down in the center of an abandoned field at [REDACTED], with no apparent transportation or mechanical infrastructure nearby. The entity bears a strong resemblance to entertainment mascots used in mid-20th century children's venues, though no verifiable record of its franchise — Jolly Jamboree — exists in any database.

LD-008 stands approximately 1.6 meters tall, with worn synthetic skin, exposed servos, and chipped paint. Its jaw is permanently fixed in a wide, unnatural grin, though some articulation remains in the head and eye modules. One eye glows a faint red, regardless of external power sources or shutdown attempts.

The entity only becomes active under specific conditions — namely low ambient lighting, proximity to electromagnetic interference, or the playback of audio resembling vintage children’s show music. When triggered, LD-008 begins slow, deliberate movement toward any nearby lifeforms, while emitting a heavily distorted laugh loop that increases in volume as it approaches.

Its vocal systems are not consistent with modern animatronic designs. LD-008 has been recorded mimicking the voices of children and adults in ways that match the speech patterns of deceased individuals — many of whom are not listed in any known personnel or civilian registries.

Efforts to dismantle or destroy LD-008 have been deemed viable. While attempts at incineration, crushing, or disassembly result in only temporary dormancy, the entity exhibits a form of self-reconstruction, utilizing nearby mechanical components to regenerate missing or damaged parts over several days. However, it has been confirmed that LD-008 can be permanently neutralized using sustained fire from armor-piercing ammunition.  

**Behavioral Traits**  
Activates only in low-light + interference-rich conditions

Laugh increases with proximity

Mimics voices of deceased or unknown individuals

Drawn to stages, mirrors, or artificial spotlights

Ignores direct commands or shutdown attempts

Returns to neutral “performance” stance when alone or inactive

**Containment Protocol**  
LD-008 is currently housed in an isolated containment chamber beneath Sector ██, designed to simulate a basic showroom floor with no power outlets or lighting infrastructure. All lighting is controlled remotely, and soundproof shielding is applied to prevent unintentional activation via stray audio.

Personnel entering the chamber must wear blackout goggles and remain in radio contact at all times. EM pulse triggers are issued to all teams in case of sudden activation. Only DIVIDE Level 3+ clearance allows access to testing data involving voice mimicry.

Playback of any vintage children's music near the entity is strictly forbidden.

**Internal Notes**  
“It didn’t bring a building with it. No wiring. No tracks. No memory.”
“It was just standing there... waiting for a show that ended decades ago.”
