**File: LD-011 — “The Echo-Faced”**  
**Designation**: Ghostly Entity / Psychological Parasite  
**Threat Level**: Class III  
**Containment Status**: Quarantine / Audio Isolation  
**Clearance Level**: DIVIDE Level 3+  

**Description**  
LD-011 appears as a female ghostly figure wearing a smooth, expressionless white mask that perfectly mimics the face of the person observing her. Her form is semi-transparent and shifts softly like a fading apparition.  

She does not speak at first, instead remaining eerily still and watching silently. After prolonged eye contact, she begins to mimic the victim’s voice in a haunting, whispering echo.  

Exposure causes intense psychological effects: victims hear distorted whispers of their own voice repeating doubts, fears, and personal secrets. Over time, this breaks down the victim’s sense of identity, causing confusion, dissociation, and eventual loss of free will.  

Once fully affected, victims behave as if possessed—repeating cryptic phrases in their own voice and losing all memory of their previous selves.

**End of exposure effects**  
Once victims lose all free will, LD-011 draws them closer with an irresistible compulsion. When she deems them no longer useful, she violently tears their face off, leaving behind a hollow shell that collapses into nothingness.
