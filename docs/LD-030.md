**File: LD-030 — “Infinite Pizza Slice”**  
**Classification**: Matter-Class Anomaly  
**Threat Level**: Class 0 (Non-hostile, novelty-class)  
**Containment Status**: Stationary / Temperature-Sealed  
**Clearance Level**: DIVIDE Level 1+  

**Description**:  
LD-030, informally known as “Infinite Pizza Slice,” is a single slice of pepperoni pizza that demonstrates continuous regenerative properties. The object was discovered in an abandoned apartment kitchen during a low-priority anomaly sweep. Despite extensive testing, the slice cannot spoil, degrade, attract bacteria, or accumulate dirt.  

When bitten into, LD-030 regenerates the removed portion in under 0.2 seconds, restoring to its original state. Repeated consumption yields no nutritional limit or negative side effects, though extended ingestion results in mild psychological effects such as emotional comfort, food-based nostalgia, and reported feelings of "childhood safety."  

LD-030 emits a faint warmth consistent with fresh oven temperature but does not burn or cool over time. It is immune to mold, exposure, water, insects, and open air.   

**Destruction Parameters**:  
While LD-030 is resistant to all standard forms of decay or damage, it can be destroyed via exposure to sustained high-intensity temperatures exceeding 2,000°C, such as industrial incineration or plasma arc exposure.  

Attempts to freeze, crush, microwave, or chemically dissolve the object have failed.  

**Behavioral Traits**:  
Self-Regenerating Matter: Instantaneous reformation of consumed parts.  

**Decay Immunity**: Cannot rot, mold, or degrade through time or exposure.  

**Clean-State Persistence**: Cannot accumulate filth, dust, or foreign substances.  

**Comfort Response**: Long-term consumption has mild psychological benefits (non-anomalous).  

**Containment Protocol**:  
LD-030 is currently stored at Site-3’s Low-Risk Object Containment Wing, inside a temperature-stable glass cube with internal environmental monitors. Casual observation is permitted, but direct interaction requires personnel to sign off on limited-item ingestion protocols.   

Use for morale or testing is allowed under Level 1 clearance, but excessive recreational use is discouraged. Any indication of attempted weaponization or replication is to be reported to Site Command.  

**Internal Note**:  
“We’ve run this through every test we have. It’s just pizza. Endless, fresh pizza.  
I’d laugh, but I’ve eaten it for lunch for the last 9 days. It’s honestly perfect.”
