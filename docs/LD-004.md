### **LD-004 — "The Swine Hybrid"**

**Designation:** Human-Pig Hybrid Anomaly  
**Clearance:** Level 3+  
**Threat Level:** Tier-2  
**Nickname:** "The Swine Hybrid" / "The Misfit"

---

#### **Description**  
LD-004, also known as *The Swine Hybrid*, is a grotesque and disturbing hybrid of human and pig, first discovered in a forgotten underground research facility. The creature has a humanoid body with the head and features of a wild boar, including tusks and a snout. It stands roughly 7 feet tall, its bloated form suggesting a fusion of genetic experiments gone wrong.

When LD-004 was discovered, there were 8 of them. Now, there is only 1 remaining because they were initially thought to be a Tier-4 anomaly.

Despite its intimidating appearance, LD-004 is a relatively weak anomaly in terms of physical power, though it remains dangerous in confined spaces or under stress. It exhibits little to no intelligence and is driven by primal instincts, primarily related to hunger and territorial behavior. Its movements are sporadic and erratic, often making it difficult to predict or contain.

#### **Duties**  
- LD-004 requires basic containment procedures to prevent it from breaching its holding area.  
- Monitoring of feeding cycles and aggressive behavior is necessary to prevent escalation.  
- Occasional studies in stress response and emotional stimuli have been attempted but yield minimal results due to the creature's limited mental faculties.

#### **Behavioral Traits**  
- **Territorial:** The creature is highly territorial and will defend its designated area aggressively if provoked.  
- **Weakness to Sound:** High-pitched noises or sudden loud sounds cause disorientation, often leading the creature to stop moving temporarily.  
- **Instinctive Hunger:** It has a strong drive to consume meat, preferring raw flesh, and will exhibit aggressive tendencies when hungry or denied food.

#### **Containment Protocol**  
LD-004 is to be contained in a standard high-security cell with reinforced barriers. It is recommended to monitor its behavioral patterns through surveillance systems to avoid direct interaction. In case of containment breach, the use of tranquilizing agents is permissible. However, since the creature is slow-moving, a controlled environment should make escape unlikely.

#### **Internal Quote**  
> "We contain it because it doesn’t belong outside. It’s not a force to fear, just one that needs to be controlled."  
> "A twisted accident of nature, and that’s all it will ever be. No intelligence, no real threat — just… something to be contained."
