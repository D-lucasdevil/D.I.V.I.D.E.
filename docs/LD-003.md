**Overview:**  
LD-003 is a humanoid aquatic anomaly resembling a young, long-haired female. It remains fully submerged in any body of water it inhabits. The entity cannot leave water-based zones and exhibits a range limit of approximately 500 meters from its origin point.

---

**Behavioral Traits:**  
In its dormant state, LD-003 drifts at the bottom of still water, showing no signs of hostility unless a qualifying target is present. Activation occurs when any individual with a recorded or suspected history of **sexual violence or abuse** enters her proximity.

Once triggered, LD-003 initiates violent environmental changes. Water levels rise abruptly, even within sealed or elevated environments, often flooding entire structures. The target is then **drowned and strangled** with disproportionate strength. Upon neutralization, LD-003 retreats into the nearest liquid source, and all water dissipates without residue.

LD-003 cannot teleport, but can phase through internal plumbing, connected piping, or linked water structures **only during active pursuit**. During these events, she can reach speeds of up to **110 km/h**, though acceleration to this speed is gradual.

**Manifestation Reports:**  
- **Incident 003-Δ:** Security logs captured LD-003 flooding a secure sublevel corridor to reach an inmate with sealed offense records.  
- **Incident 003-Ψ:** Containment cell found fully submerged. Forensic review revealed previously hidden misconduct by deceased staff member. No survivors.

**Notes:**  
LD-003 does not interact with individuals lacking qualifying behavioral history unless physically provoked or restrained. Extraction attempts have failed — the entity becomes incorporeal outside liquid mediums.

**Containment Suggestions:**  
No active containment necessary due to range limitations.  
**Strict clearance vetting** is required before entry into any water-occupied area within a 500-meter radius of LD-003’s known location.  
**Personnel with any history of sexual misconduct are permanently barred from proximity.**
