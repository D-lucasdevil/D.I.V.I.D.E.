**File: LD-037.5 — “The Drowned Pulse”**  
**Designation**: Unknown Entity / Pulse-Origin Anomaly  
**Threat Level**: Class III (Predicted)  
**Containment Status**: Uncontained — Presumed Destroyed  
**Clearance Level**: DIVIDE Level 3+ Required for Access  

**Pulse Event**:    
On ██/██/2025, a Level III Pulse was detected originating approximately 12,400 meters below sea level, near the center of the Atlantic Ocean. The pulse registered briefly before all monitoring buoys in the area ceased functioning. One buoy captured a frame of a large, unidentifiable silhouette moments before system failure.  

**Anomaly Description**:  
LD-037.5 is currently classified as an unconfirmed anomaly due to lack of physical evidence. Based on pulse readings and brief telemetry, it is theorized to be a massive, deep-sea entity or construct of unknown origin. Initial predictions estimate its size between 60–110 meters long, possibly organic in nature. Its emergence caused localized electromagnetic distortion, interference with sonar, and collapse of several deep-sea communication nodes.  

As of now, the Foundation presumes LD-037.5 did not survive the intense pressure and environmental hostility of its emergence point. No secondary activity has been registered in the vicinity.  

**Notable Facts**:  

First Tier III Pulse to result in presumed immediate neutralization.  

Cause of death: Deep oceanic pressure rupture (unconfirmed).  

No remains recovered. Entire investigation zone remains a restricted dead zone.  

SORAD (Special Oceanic Retrieval and Analysis Division) is maintaining deep-sensor surveillance in case of renewed activity.  

**Containment Recommendations**:  

Deep ocean probes to continue passive scans for any irregular movement or structural anomalies.
