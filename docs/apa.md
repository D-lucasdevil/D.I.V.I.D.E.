**Description**:  
APA-01 was the first human to survive direct exposure to a Tier-4 anomaly. Instead of dying, they adapted — physically and cognitively. Now, the APA designation is reserved for agents who exhibit extreme resilience and combat intuition, capable of surviving the worst anomalies D.I.V.I.D.E. has ever faced.

**Quote**:  
*"We don’t send APA to clean up the mess. We send them to end it."*
