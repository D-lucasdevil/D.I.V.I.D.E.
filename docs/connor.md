# Researcher Profile: Dr. Connor

**Clearance Level:** D.I.V.I.D.E.  
**Assigned Division:** LD-Anomaly Containment  
**Status:** [REDACTED]  

## Background:
Dr. Connor was once a theoretical physicist focused on multidimensional decay and entropy tethering. In 2010, he was recruited into D.I.V.I.D.E. after independently detecting “noise” from the first recorded anomaly (LD-001) — two years before the organization's formation.

His warnings were dismissed as schizophrenic delusions by every institution he approached… until LD-001 manifested in public space, and D.I.V.I.D.E. made contact.

## Role Within D.I.V.I.D.E.:
After developing the VALEN Protocol — a dimensional triangulation method capable of locating temporal fractures used by anomalies — Connor was granted full D.I.V.I.D.E. clearance. He remains one of the few operatives trusted to interact directly with high-tier LDs.

## Notable Files:
- **R-Ω-VALEN-T01** — Research notes theorizing D as a corrupted, yandere-coded entity, emotionally tethered to LD-001

## Personality & Controversy:
Feared and respected across the organization, Connor’s intense fixation on LD entities — especially [REDACTED] — sparked internal concerns about compromised loyalty. That fear was extinguished during an unsanctioned test when, without hesitation, Connor issued the command to terminate the entity.

The attempt failed.

But the message was clear:

*“I don’t want to understand it. I want to bury it so deep reality forgets it existed.”*
