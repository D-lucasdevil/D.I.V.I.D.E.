**File: LD-21.5 — “????”**  
**Designation**: Unknown Entity / Partial Dimensional Manifestation  
**Threat Level**: Unknown  
**Containment Status**: Uncontained — Initial Manifestation Only  
**Clearance Level**: DIVIDE Level 2 Required  
**Pulse Level**: Type II Pulse Event Logged  

**Overview**:  
On [REDACTED], a Type II Pulse was recorded at [Location Coordinates Scrambled], indicating the partial arrival of an unidentified anomaly into baseline reality. No direct contact has yet been established with the entity, and no known visual or audio footage exists aside from the anomaly-triggered distortion in surveillance feeds and a singular spike across dimensional resonance monitors.  

The Pulse signature suggests the entity is moderate in threat, with properties aligning with Class II phenomena: unpredictable, but not yet inherently hostile. 

**Current Status**:  
No reoccurring activity has been detected since the original Pulse.  

A containment perimeter has been established around the original location of the Pulse.  

Observation teams remain on standby in case of full emergence or second-phase activity.  

All data related to LD-21.5 is to be classified under DIVIDE encryption protocol pending further discovery.
