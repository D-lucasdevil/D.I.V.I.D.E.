**Description**:  
LD-033 is a humanoid, shadow-like entity approximately 2.1 meters tall, lacking any discernible facial features or mass. The entity exclusively targets law enforcement officers or military personnel with a history of severe misconduct — including but not limited to abuse of power, unjustified violence, and criminal cover-ups. Individuals without such histories appear entirely invisible to LD-033 and may even be unaware of its presence.   

The entity does not attack immediately. Instead, it initiates a prolonged psychological torment phase, manifesting in the following ways:  

**Hallucinations**: Subjects report seeing LD-033 in reflections, shadows, or within the back seat of their patrol car.  

**Malfunctions**: Electrical devices, dash cams, and radios often fail around the entity’s presence.  

**Voices & Screams**: Whispering voices, distorted radio signals, and the sound of victims pleading are commonly heard.  

When the subject "crosses a final line" (criteria unknown), LD-033 manifests physically and eliminates the target through a fatal vehicular accident. Recorded incidents include high-speed crashes, derailed trains, and on one occasion, the destruction of an entire precinct garage.  

**Behavioral Traits**:  

**Selective Manifestation**: Only appears to its intended victim. Others may witness the aftermath but not the entity itself.  

**Escalation Pattern**: Torment increases over days or weeks. Once LD-033 enters the subject’s vehicle, death is imminent.  

**Killable/Containable**: Though extremely resistant to damage, it can be killed or trapped through currently undisclosed means. DIVIDE is investigating containment options.  

**Containment Protocol**:  
Currently uncontained. Efforts to identify future targets before escalation are ongoing. Undercover Division agents are embedded in law enforcement agencies to monitor behavior patterns that may trigger LD-033’s activity.  

All police-related fatalities involving vehicle crashes are to be reviewed for signs of LD-033 involvement. If confirmed, affected regions are to be flagged for anomalous surveillance.  

If containment is deemed not worth kill on sight.  

**Internal Note**:

“It’s not random. It waits until they think they got away with it. Then it rides with them, real quiet. You don’t see it… until it’s too late.”
