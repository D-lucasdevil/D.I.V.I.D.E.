### B.E.R.S.E.R.K. — "Bio-Enhanced Rapid Strike & Extraction Recon Killteam"

**Designation:** High-Fatality Anomaly Annihilation Unit  
**Clearance:** Level 5+  
**Nickname:** “Warhammers” / “The Last Door” / “Walking Cataclysm”

---

#### Description  
B.E.R.S.E.R.K. is a classified rapid-response killteam developed by the D.I.V.I.D.E. Special Warfare Division. Composed of genetically and cybernetically enhanced operatives, this unit is engineered for zero-prep, maximum-impact anomaly eradication.

Where APA is a scalpel, B.E.R.S.E.R.K. is a wrecking ball — deployed only when overwhelming, unapologetic force is the last remaining option. When containment fails and diplomacy dies, this unit drops from orbit into the heart of destruction.

Hit fast. Hit hard. Leave nothing standing.

---

#### Duties  
- Eliminate Tier-3+ anomalies in high-fatality, escalation-prone zones  
- Respond to catastrophic breaches where standard containment collapsed  
- Deploy to sectors marked as expendable or lost  
- Execute total obliteration when APA is unavailable or overkill

---

#### Features & Equipment  

 **Genetic Rage Protocols**  
Operatives are implanted with Rage Core bioware — inducing a controlled berserker state under threat. This state enhances strength, aggression, speed, and pain suppression while maintaining coordinated movement with the team.

 **Neural Combat Synchronization**  
Linked via tactical neural-net implants, B.E.R.S.E.R.K. moves as one. Reactions are hive-fast, sensory data is shared instantly, and no threat goes unseen.

 **Shockframe Armor**  
Custom-built exo-frames resistant to kinetic, concussive, and anomalous forces. Integrated systems include:  
- Kinetic Boosters  
- Cognitohazard Filters  
- Spatial Stabilizers  
- Adrenal Override Modules  
Designed to punch through walls and anomalies.

 **Overkill Arsenal**  
Tier-0 clearance loadouts. Every operative is armed to terminate existence, not preserve it. Includes:  
- Micro-fusion cannons  
- Dimensional warhammers  
- Anomaly disruptors  
- Megaton plasma slugs  
Ammunition is measured in kilotons. Precision is optional.

 **Psychological Conditioning**  
B.E.R.S.E.R.K. units are emotionally dulled, but not mindless. Hesitation is purged through intense neural-loop indoctrination. Loyalty is to the mission alone — not survival, not ethics, not restraint.

#### Deployment Criteria  
B.E.R.S.E.R.K. is only activated under extreme threat conditions:  
- Tier-3+ anomaly has neutralized multiple strike teams  
- Standard containment failed or escalated the breach  
- APA units are unavailable, occupied, or deemed excessive  
- Sector is designated as non-recoverable (“Expendable”)  

Currently ranked just below APA in force class. However, due to the collateral scale, B.E.R.S.E.R.K. is reserved for “no future” operations only. APA remains the most powerful unit in existence — capable of suppressing global-level anomalies — but at the cost of planetary stability.  

B.E.R.S.E.R.K. clears cities. APA clears continents.

#### Code Black Record: Operation Hellmouth  
A Class-5 interdimensional rupture occurred at Containment Site ██. Entity [REDACTED] emerged across 3 sectors. APA-01 was engaged off-site and unavailable.

B.E.R.S.E.R.K. was dropped into the epicenter via orbital shockpods.

Visual data terminated within 3 minutes.  
Sound logs captured only static, screams, and one sentence:  
> “B.E.R.S.E.R.K. has entered the pit.”

12 minutes later, the anomaly ceased.  
24 hours later, recon teams found:  
- Entity: obliterated  
- Facility: half-vaporized  
- Operatives: recovered alive… and smiling and laughing.
- That day 6 berserker operatives died rest alive.

#### Clearance Warning  
> Level 6+ Only: Do NOT deploy B.E.R.S.E.R.K. in any area expected to be salvageable.  
> Estimated collateral radius: 55 KM minimum.  
> Zone is classified as DEATH ZONE post-deployment.  
> Survivability is improbable. Restoration: not a goal.

#### Internal Quote  
> “We don’t knock. We detonate. And obliterate.”  
> “Containment failed? We’ll erase the coordinates.”  
> “APA is the scalpel. We are the warhammer.”
