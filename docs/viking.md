B.E.R.S.E.R.K. — Bio-Enhanced Rapid Strike & Extraction Recon Killteam

Overview:
B.E.R.S.E.R.K. is a classified rapid-response killteam composed of genetically and cybernetically enhanced operatives, engineered for zero-prep, maximum-impact anomaly engagements. Where APA units are surgical, B.E.R.S.E.R.K. is a wrecking ball — unleashed only when overwhelming force is the last and only option.

Created by the D.I.V.I.D.E. Special Warfare Division, B.E.R.S.E.R.K. operatives are dropped into high-fatality, non-containable zones where all other protocols have failed. Their mission is simple:

Hit fast. Hit hard. Leave nothing standing.

Core Directive:
“If APA is the scalpel… B.E.R.S.E.R.K. is the warhammer.”

Notable Features:
 **Genetic Rage Protocols**
Each operative is equipped with “Rage Core” bioware — a controlled berserker-state activator that boosts strength, pain suppression, aggression, and speed. Rage Mode turns operatives into walking anomalies, while still maintaining unit-level coordination.

 **Neural Combat Synchronization**
Operatives are linked via tactical neural-net implants, sharing sensory and combat data in real-time. They move and react like a hive mind — overwhelming threats with impossible speed and precision.

 **Shockframe Armor**
Advanced exo-frames capable of tanking concussive, kinetic, and anomalous force. Armor systems include:
- Kinetic Boosters
- Cognitohazard Filters
- Spatial Stabilizers
- Internal Adrenal Overrides

Built to breach walls, realms, and logic.

 **Overkill Loadouts**
B.E.R.S.E.R.K. has Tier-0 weapon clearance. Their arsenal includes:
- Micro-fusion cannons
- Dimensional warhammers
- Anomaly disruptors
- Plasma slugs measured in megatons, not rounds

Collateral damage is not a concern.

**Psychological Conditioning**
Emotionally dulled, not mindless — B.E.R.S.E.R.K. units are conditioned to erase hesitation. Ethics, fear, and empathy are suspended in favor of mission execution. Their loyalty lies only with the task, regardless of the cost.

They are not built to contain.
They are built to end.

Deployment Criteria:
B.E.R.S.E.R.K. is only deployed when:
- A Tier-3 or higher anomaly has wiped out multiple squads.
- Standard containment has completely failed or triggered exponential anomaly growth.
- The operational sector is marked expendable.
- APA units are unavailable.

As of current protocol, B.E.R.S.E.R.K. units are second only to APA squads in power — used only when APA is either occupied or when APA squad is deemed to use too much power and destroy area bigger than 55 km as of now B.E.R.S.E.R.K. is second to APA, but APA when fully without their limiters can go 500 km area deemed DEATH.

**CODE BLACK RECORD: Operation Hellmouth**
During a breach at Containment Site ██, an interdimensional entity (classified: REDACTED) manifested violently across layered dimensional folds. APA-01 was engaged off-site.

B.E.R.S.E.R.K. was launched via orbital shockpods into the epicenter.

All visuals terminated within 3 minutes.

Audio logs captured static, screams, and a single voice:
“B.E.R.S.E.R.K. has entered the pit.”

12 minutes later, all anomalous activity ceased.
24 hours later, recon teams found:
- The entity: destroyed.
- Half the facility: gone.
- B.E.R.S.E.R.K. operatives: alive... and smiling.

**WARNING: LEVEL 6+ CLEARANCE ONLY**
Do NOT deploy B.E.R.S.E.R.K. in any area you wish to preserve.
Once deployed, a 55 KM radius around impact is considered a **DEATH ZONE**.
Survivors are improbable. Survivability is not the goal.

**Team Motto:**
“We don’t knock. We detonate. And obliterate.”
