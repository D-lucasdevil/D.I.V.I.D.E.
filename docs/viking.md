### B.E.R.S.E.R.K. — "Bio-Enhanced Rapid Strike & Extraction Recon Killteam"

**Designation:** High-Fatality Anomaly Annihilation Unit  
**Clearance:** Level 5+  
**Nickname:** “Warhammers” / “The Last Door” / “Walking Cataclysm”

---

#### Description  
B.E.R.S.E.R.K. is a classified last-resort strike team built for overwhelming force and high-fatality anomaly engagements. Genetically and cybernetically enhanced, its operatives are engineered for berserker-level aggression while retaining precise team coordination through neural synchronization.

When all protocols fail — when APA is unavailable, and the threat is burning through reality itself — B.E.R.S.E.R.K. is dropped straight into the heart of the nightmare.

They are not meant to stabilize.  
They are meant to destroy.
