**Overview**:  
LD-036 refers to a newly discovered species of humanoid entities that exhibit highly predatory behavior. These beings specifically seek out stranded individuals in disabled vehicles—cars, trucks, or buses—primarily in rural areas across the USA.  

Upon locating a target, LD-036 will attempt to gain entry by knocking on or manipulating the vehicle’s door. If the door remains unopened, the entities escalate by manipulating electronic devices such as car radios or mobile phones, producing fabricated signals and sounds to create an illusion of normalcy or safety. Once the target attempts rescue or leaves the vehicle, the group coordinates to ambush and attack.  

**Behavior and Characteristics**:  

LD-036 operate exclusively in groups that match the number of potential prey individuals.  

Each entity claims one victim per hunt; if group size falls below the number of prey, infighting and mutual destruction occur.  

They induce severe hallucinations in prolonged victims, heightening psychological trauma and disorientation.  

Vulnerable to conventional weaponry; classified as a moderate threat due to ease of killing but high coordination and deception.  

Echo-9 task force reports confirm 281 kills attributed to LD-036 as of ██/██/████; civilian casualties are estimated between 400-500.  

**Containment and Current Status**:  

The original LD-036 pulse was detected in Louisiana, where the first confirmed sighting occurred.  

Two specimens are currently held in Vault 36 under maximum security.  

Ongoing extermination orders are in effect; all encountered LD-036 units are to be eliminated on sight.  

Active task forces continue hunting to prevent further civilian casualties.  

**Notes**:  

Due to their manipulative and coordinated nature, victims are advised to avoid any attempts at vehicle repair or leaving disabled vehicles unattended in affected zones.  

Psychological support units are recommended for survivors to address hallucinations and trauma.  

It has been aproved to give all civilian's the right to know about LD-036 and recomended once all thing's seem like it is LD-036 to fire and try to kill said entity.  
It is also being daily broadcasted to DO NOT stop or open door for anyone while driving across rural area abandoned by civilians or trafic.
