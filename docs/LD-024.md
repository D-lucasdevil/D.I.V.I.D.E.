**Description**  
LD-024 manifests as an ordinary-looking children's playground slide constructed from rusted metal and faded red plastic. The slide appears randomly in forested areas across the globe, always isolated from civilization and accompanied by a sharp drop in temperature and unexplained electromagnetic interference.  

When a subject slides down LD-024, they are instantly transported into a looping interdimensional space. Each loop becomes progressively more surreal and dangerous, with increasing evidence of decay, unnatural physics, and aggressive environmental hostility.  

On the fifth loop, the subject enters the domain of an unidentified hostile entity. This space resembles a warped, fog-covered forest with endless darkness and a barely-visible red sky. The entity within — designated LD-024-1 — appears humanoid but is capable of moving silently and at high speeds, using camouflage and spatial distortion to stalk intruders.  

**Behavioral Traits**  
Slide appears and vanishes at random across global forested regions  

Emits low, vibrating hum when active  

Sliding down triggers transportation to a looping pocket dimension  

Each loop is different, progressively more unstable and disturbing  

Fifth loop introduces LD-024-1, a predatory entity that will stalk and attempt to kill any human inside  

Entity regenerates after a full cycle ends (when all people leave or die)  

Slide vanishes once the final person completes all loops or is consumed  

Slide reappears in a new random forest globally  

**Entity LD-024-1 Details**  
Humanoid in shape, vaguely skeletal with deer-like horns  

Eyes emit a faint red glow in the dark  

Remains perfectly still unless watched, and stalks in complete silence  

Displays hunting behavior: will isolate, toy with, then capture targets  

Victims caught are sacrificed violently; their body is absorbed by the terrain  
 
Entity is killable, but will regenerate once dimension resets  

**Containment Protocol**  
Due to LD-024’s unpredictable nature and ability to teleport globally, direct containment is currently impossible. The following protocols are in place:  

Global surveillance systems monitor sudden anomalous energy spikes in forested regions  

Civilians are to be evacuated upon manifestation using localized lockdowns under cover of environmental hazard drills  

Any person who enters the slide is considered at extreme risk and must be monitored through drone and sensor tracking (if possible)  

Termination of LD-024-1 is allowed for research purposes but is considered futile long-term  

Termination of LD-024 is allowed when next encountered the whole slide is to be burned down and exploded to pieces right after.  

**Internal Note**  
"You think it's just a ride, until the slide grows teeth."
