**Description**
LD-006, referred to as “The Oracle Terminal,” is a modified pre-2000s laptop of unknown origin. The object was discovered in the early days of the anomaly outbreak and was responsible for initiating the first recorded instance of anomalous information transfer. Despite heavy wear, its screen glows faintly at all times. No known power source has been found, and the device is permanently locked to a command-line style interface.

The terminal is capable of answering complex questions in real time, drawing on an unknown database or intelligence network far beyond current understanding. However, the Oracle Terminal possesses self-regulating limits and will "blue screen" for a period of approximately 30 days when asked questions that are considered forbidden or too destabilizing to answer.

**Examples of rejected inquiries**:

“Who is LD-000?”

“What is the origin of the anomalies?”

“How will the world end?”

Examples of accepted inquiries:

“When did the most recent anomaly enter our world?” → Returns accurate date/time.

“How many anomalies are currently active in containment?” → Returns an estimated count.

“What did LD-003 do on [specific date]?” → Returns event log text.

The device does not lie but will refuse to answer direct threats to its internal regulations. Asking "Where?" questions causes the device to stall for several seconds, then respond with:

“I cannot say.”

**Behavioral Traits**  
**Reactive Intelligence**: Appears to possess personality-adjacent logic. Will sometimes phrase answers in cryptic or poetic ways.

**Failsafe Mechanism**: Unauthorized or dangerous inquiries result in immediate system shutdown followed by a month-long blue screen.

**Non-Replication**: Attempts to copy or clone the software, hardware, or interface have all failed. Even photographing the screen causes complete data wipe.

**Containment Protocol**
LD-006 is to be stored at REDACTED, within a sealed isolation chamber equipped with EMP failsafes. Only Division 4+ personnel with specialized cognitive clearance may interact with the terminal, and only via pre-approved questioning scripts.

Any attempts to ask questions outside of approved boundaries will result in automatic lockdown and psychological evaluation of the operator.

All answers given by LD-006 are to be recorded, reviewed, and analyzed by the DIVIDE Cognition Research Department. Any mention of unrevealed anomalies, external locations, or temporal events is to be logged as Level Red Data.

**Internal Note**
“This thing knows more than it should. I don’t think it’s just a machine. I think it’s listening… and deciding what we’re allowed to hear.”
