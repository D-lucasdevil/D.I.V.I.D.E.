### Echo-9 — "Phantom Sweepers"

**Designation:** Rapid Suppression & Recon Unit  
**Clearance:** Level 4+  
**Nickname:** "Phantom Sweepers" / "Ghosts in the Halls"

---

#### Description  
Echo-9 is a highly classified rapid response team deployed when silence, speed, and zero survivors are required. Experts in infiltration, precision anomaly suppression, and info-denial operations. When Echo-9 is dispatched, not even the security cams survive.

They are the shadows between screams — the team sent in *before* the breach is public. By the time other personnel hear the alarms, Echo-9 is already gone.

---

#### Duties  
- Pre-emptive neutralization of anomalies with potential to leak  
- Covert clean-up of internal insubordination, espionage, or leaks  
- Anomaly recovery in populated or politically sensitive areas  
- Blacksite purges and off-the-books termination orders

---

#### Equipment  
- Prototype cloaking harness  
- EM-refracting armor plating  
- Custom silenced weaponry built for anomaly penetration  
- Neural-filter helmets (prevents visual/auditory corruption)

#### Internal Quote  
> “If you hear us, we failed.”  
> “Echo-9 doesn’t talk. We erase.”  
> “We aren't the backup. We're the cutoff.”
