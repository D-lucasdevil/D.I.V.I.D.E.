**Description**:  
LD-016 is a well-worn, antique revolver of unknown manufacture. The revolver possesses seemingly infinite ammunition, with bullets mysteriously replenishing after every discharge. Tests confirm no conventional means of refilling the chambers are possible.  

The revolver exhibits a unique bonding property: once fired by an individual, the weapon becomes psychically “linked” to that user. The gun cannot be effectively wielded or fired by anyone else unless the bonded user is deceased, and the weapon is physically taken from their remains.  

When the revolver is used to lethally wound or kill a target, a portion of the victim’s life force is transferred to the wielder, causing accelerated healing of wounds and fatigue reduction. However, this effect is limited to a threshold, preventing indefinite or excessive regeneration.  

**Bonding Effects**:  

The revolver will reject attempts to fire by anyone other than the bonded user, often jamming or producing misfires.  

If an unbonded person tries to forcibly use LD-016, severe feedback effects occur, including nausea, disorientation, and in extreme cases, fainting.  

The bond may trigger psychically, preventing the bonded user from willingly relinquishing the weapon without fatal consequences.  

**Containment Protocol**:  
LD-016 is stored in a specialized containment locker equipped with biometric locks and blood sample authorization protocols. Only personnel authorized at DIVIDE Level 3+ clearance with verified psychological screening may handle or test the weapon.  

All bonded users are to be monitored regularly for signs of psychological dependence or behavioral changes. The revolver must never be used in live-field operations without explicit approval and backup.  

**Internal Note**:  
“Andy’s Revolver may appear like a blessing in combat, but its bond is a curse — once chosen, you carry it until death.”
