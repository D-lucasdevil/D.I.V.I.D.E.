**Description**:  
LD-017 is a blackened bone-and-silver amulet with unknown markings that shift when observed it is palm sized. When held, the bearer is immediately imprinted with knowledge of a basic summoning ritual — enough to summon low-tier demonic entities after offering one human sacrifice to "charge" the trinket.  

Each additional sacrifice enhances the bearer’s ritual knowledge, progressing in stages. At approximately 80–100 sacrifices, bearers begin performing complex sigil-based rituals written in human blood, allowing summoning of stronger entities and negotiation of more dangerous pacts.  

These pacts grant temporary demonic powers, including:  

Healing/regeneration  

Limb regeneration  

Enhanced strength/speed  

Limited precognition (future-vision)  

Breath of black fire (lethal to user)  

However, the trinket does not permit resurrection of the dead — even after 766 recorded sacrifices by a single subject, this was deemed impossible by a high-tier entity.  

At 666 sacrifices, one subject learned to "channel" his demon's power directly:  

Moderate bullet resistance  

Accelerated regeneration  

Physical strength sufficient to throw vehicles  
This required constant sacrifices to maintain. Example cost:  

30 minutes of healing: ~20 sacrifices  

Enhanced durability: ~15  

Temporary strength boost: ~50  
All powers fade quickly without continuous offerings.  

**Known Entities**:  

Low-Tier Demon: Grants visions of possible futures. Limited in power. Cooperative.  

High-Tier Demon: Capable of devouring lesser demons. Makes major deals. Unstable but communicative.  

Unnamed Entity: Seen once. Countless eyes and hands. Consumed subject soul without ritual. Not responsive to deals or sacrifices. Likely not bound to trinket rules.  

**Restrictions**:  

The trinket is not soul-bound; any user may activate it if charged.  

Without proper demon approval, use becomes highly dangerous.  

Demons cannot kill without a deal unless enraged.  

One user, codenamed “Tar Soul,” was reportedly granted access to summon without ritual every 200 sacrifices by the High-Tier demon.  

**APA Enforcement Notes**:  
**To prevent AT-class defection**:  

Subjects implanted with high-explosive collars and internal charges  

Their families are detained and used to simulate distress over live comms.  

Should a subject flee or betray containment, APA-Taskforce is to hunt, recapture, or execute.  

Post-escape punishments include live torture broadcasts to all AT-class to maintain obedience.  

**Current Status**:  
LD-016 remains one of the most high-risk, temptation-based anomalies under DIVIDE control. Its power is seductive, corruptive, and fundamentally unreliable.
