### Phantom Division — "Containment First"

**Designation:** Strategic Anomaly Suppression & Containment Unit  
**Clearance:** Level 4+  
**Nickname:** “The Net” / “Glass Box Crew” / “The Calm Hand”

---

#### Description  
Phantom Division is a specialized taskforce focused solely on the **containment** and stabilization of anomalies — deployed when brute force is unnecessary, and the situation still allows for recovery, study, or suppression.

While lacking the raw firepower of APA or B.E.R.S.E.R.K., Phantom Division excels in tactical precision, anomaly analysis, and adaptive field engineering. Their success is measured not in body count, but in how little gets destroyed.

If APA is the scalpel and B.E.R.S.E.R.K. is the warhammer — Phantom is the net. They catch what others would rather crush.

#### Duties  
- Primary anomaly containment operations in survivable zones  
- Establishing mobile and long-term suppression fields  
- Stabilizing breaches in populated or research-critical areas  
- Supporting recovery teams and pre-extraction lockdowns  
- Hand-off to higher units if escalation occurs

#### Equipment  
 **Containment Packs** — Deployable stasis generators, field cages, spatial anchors   
 **Anomaly Classifiers** — Real-time scanners for threat level and interaction mapping   
 **Modular Restraint Gear** — Configurable to fit biological, energy-based, or metaphysical entities   
 **Cognition-Shielded Suits** — Defends against subtle memetic and infohazard leaks   
 **Comms Disruptors** — Prevents anomalies from transmitting/interacting with external systems
