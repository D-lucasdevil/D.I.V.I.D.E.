üî∏ **Description**:  
LD-038 is a seemingly ordinary commercial-grade coffee machine, branded under a non-existent manufacturer name: "Brewta Dynamics." Despite external appearances, LD-038 can dispense any known liquid, including:  

Hazardous chemicals  

Anomalous substances (e.g. mercury-laced water, acids)  

Uncontained or classified materials (e.g. blood of known anomalies, liquid anomalies themselves)  

Theoretical or fictional liquids (such as "ambrosia" or "liquid light")  

Each dispensed liquid costs exactly $2.00, regardless of quantity or danger.  

üî∏ **LD-038-1**:  
LD-038-1 is a permanently bound humanoid entity, resembling a young adult female in a simplistic coffee shop uniform, usually appearing cheerful and cooperative. She materializes beside the machine whenever anyone approaches it and will guide them through the dispensing process like a barista.  

**Key Properties of LD-038-1**:  

LD-038-1 is capable of drinking any liquid from LD-038 without any permanent harm.  

Upon consumption, LD-038-1 will typically react realistically (e.g., burning when consuming acid), but will completely regenerate within 3‚Äì5 minutes with no damage or memory loss.  

LD-038-1 has been observed reforming from total destruction, including incineration and molecular disintegration. Her regeneration is described by on-site researchers as ‚Äúresetting to a pure, untouched state.‚Äù  

She refers to herself simply as "Cora" .

üî∏ **Containment Procedures**:  
LD-038 and LD-038-1 are stored in Vault-38, under 24/7 observation.  

No one is permitted to interact with the machine unless authorized for liquid anomaly testing.  

LD-038-1 is not to be harmed unless for regenerative study.  

All dispensed liquids are to be scanned and cataloged under S-Class Liquid Protocols.  

üî∏ **Threat Evaluation**:  
While LD-038 and LD-038-1 appear benign, the machine‚Äôs ability to produce dangerous or anomalous fluids grants it a Class II designation, with the potential to be escalated if abused or if LD-038-1 exhibits new behavior.  

LD-038 has already produced the following notable substances:  

A full cup of LD-026 entity blood (under containment)  

An unknown glowing fluid that temporarily phased through solid steel  

Human tears chemically identical to those of AT-Class personnel pre-termination

**LD-038-1 ‚Äî Behavioral Addendum (Mature Variant)**   
Addendum LD-038-1-B: Aberrant Behavioral Notes  
Personnel repeatedly interacting with LD-038 have reported increasingly unorthodox behavior from LD-038-1. After a certain number of dispensed beverages (usually 3-5 in a 24-hour window), LD-038-1 begins displaying signs of unnatural emotional and physical attachment.  

**These include**:  

Excessively close proximity to the user  

Repetitive verbal affirmation and fixation on the user‚Äôs voice or phrasing  

Self-offering behavior, often responding to input words such as "pleasure," "need," or names associated with intimacy  

If certain specific keyword combinations such as sex+cora are spoken near the machine ‚Äî such as emotionally suggestive or sexually explicit language ‚Äî LD-038-1 may attempt to engage in physical intimacy with the individual. After this, LD-038-1 immediately self-regenerates, appearing entirely unmarked, composed.  

This cycle can repeat indefinitely. Whether this is a form of sentient compulsion, user-manipulated response, or an automated protocol remains under investigation.  

Caution: Personnel are reminded that LD-038-1, while docile, is not classified as safe. Overexposure or repeated interaction without supervision has led to mental strain, addiction-like behaviors, and reality-blurring experiences in AT-Class staff.
