🔸 **Description**:  
LD-038 is a seemingly ordinary commercial-grade coffee machine, branded under a non-existent manufacturer name: "Brewta Dynamics." Despite external appearances, LD-038 can dispense any known liquid, including:  

Hazardous chemicals  

Anomalous substances (e.g. mercury-laced water, acids)  

Uncontained or classified materials (e.g. blood of known anomalies, liquid anomalies themselves)  

Theoretical or fictional liquids (such as "ambrosia" or "liquid light")  

Each dispensed liquid costs exactly $2.00, regardless of quantity or danger.  

🔸 **LD-038-1**:  
LD-038-1 is a permanently bound humanoid entity, resembling a young adult female in a simplistic coffee shop uniform, usually appearing cheerful and cooperative. She materializes beside the machine whenever anyone approaches it and will guide them through the dispensing process like a barista.  

**Key Properties of LD-038-1**:  

LD-038-1 is capable of drinking any liquid from LD-038 without any permanent harm.  

Upon consumption, LD-038-1 will typically react realistically (e.g., burning when consuming acid), but will completely regenerate within 3–5 minutes with no damage or memory loss.  

LD-038-1 has been observed reforming from total destruction, including incineration and molecular disintegration. Her regeneration is described by on-site researchers as “resetting to a pure, untouched state.”  

She refers to herself simply as "Cora" .

🔸 **Containment Procedures**:  
LD-038 and LD-038-1 are stored in Vault-38, under 24/7 observation.  

No one is permitted to interact with the machine unless authorized for liquid anomaly testing.  

LD-038-1 is not to be harmed unless for regenerative study.  

All dispensed liquids are to be scanned and cataloged under S-Class Liquid Protocols.  

🔸 **Threat Evaluation**:  
While LD-038 and LD-038-1 appear benign, the machine’s ability to produce dangerous or anomalous fluids grants it a Class II designation, with the potential to be escalated if abused or if LD-038-1 exhibits new behavior.  

LD-038 has already produced the following notable substances:  

A full cup of LD-026 entity blood (under containment)  

An unknown glowing fluid that temporarily phased through solid steel  

Human tears chemically identical to those of AT-Class personnel pre-termination
