**Description**
LD-007 is a humanoid entity only known to manifest after direct interaction with a worn, leather-bound children's book referred to as “The Visitor’s Folklore.” The book appears hand-illustrated and written in a cryptic rhyme structure. Once a subject reads the book aloud to completion, the anomaly becomes active.

The entity, visually resembling a distorted humanoid estimated at over 2.1 meters tall, materializes within a proximity radius of the reader. The biology of LD-007 is not fully human, showing irregular joint placements, a semi-fixed grin, and eyes that remain unresponsive to light. Prior to entry, LD-007 will deliver three distinct knocks on a window or transparent surface near the subject's last known location.

Victims taken by LD-007 are never recovered. It is unknown whether they are terminated or transported to another dimension, as no biological residue, digital trace, or sensory anomaly is ever left behind. The entity does not engage with non-human lifeforms.

The book itself is the true anomaly. Without it, LD-007 cannot appear.
