"corpse was incinirated"  


 **Summary**:  
This anomaly, believed to originate from the entity responsible for the “Assessment Examination” events, was a shapeshifter mimicking lost or isolated individuals. It gained access to high-clearance facilities by replicating voices, emotions, and memories. The  
 subject was indistinguishable from its target in both speech and behavior.  

 **Termination Report**:  
Subject was neutralized after containment breach #3 when APA Operator J. Kardos deployed experimental cryo-rounds followed by incendiary treatment. Subject responded with violent spasms and vocal distortions before collapsing. Post-mortem analysis revealed no internal organs — only a thick black fluid that immediately evaporated upon exposure to oxygen.  

**Final Words Recorded by Entity**:  

“haha..ha...”
