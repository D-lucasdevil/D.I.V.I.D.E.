**LD-010 — “The Pactbound”**   
“Surveillance capture following post-encounter extraction. Entity briefly manifested before dissipating in a burst of ash and sigil-fire.”   

**Description**   
LD-010 is a humanoid anomaly resembling a sharply dressed infernal figure, often appearing as a tall, horned woman in a suit or other formalwear. It manifests during moments of critical decision-making or temptation, specifically when the subject is isolated and under psychological stress. While no two sightings are identical, all witnesses report similar core traits: glowing red eyes and an unsettlingly calm voice.   

LD-010 does not force interaction. It offers deals, contracts, or "help", requiring some form of verbal agreement. Victims who accept are marked with a sigil somewhere on their body, after which alterations to probability, emotion, and perception begin to occur. Over time, they degrade—both physically and mentally—until either death or full integration with the anomaly.   

This entity is believed to originate from a corrupted contract-space fracture and exhibits traits common to “hell-born” parasitic intelligences. The anomaly was first documented following contact between LD-001. LD-001 refused LD-010’s initial offer, but requested the ability to contact her in the future.   

LD-001: “There will be no payment for this. No life, no nothing. You’re giving me this so that I can contact you for free—completely free—willingly. There is no deal to be made as of now.”   

LD-010 responded with a brief silence before smiling and replying:   
“Of course. You’re an interesting one. I’ll keep a close—really close—eye on you. I really like you. Oh well, here you go, and tah-ta.”   

She then applied a small sigil onto his body and disappeared.  

**Recorded Interaction Summary**  
 Entity appeared during [REDACTED]   
 Offered an “easy path forward” in exchange for an “unspoken cost”   
 LD-001 refused   
 Entity laughed, vanished, and was later seen observing from behind one-way reflective surfaces   
 
**Behavioral Traits**   
Speaks all known languages   

Cannot be physically touched unless pact is accepted    

Exists partially out of phase with baseline reality    

Marks those who accept, weakening their resistance over time   

Occasionally gifts items with unpredictable side effects (sweets, keys, notes)   

**Confirmed Pact Outcomes**   
 Test Subject AT-2191 accepted a “strength pact” — later crushed self by accident during physical trial   
 Test Subject AT-3452 requested knowledge — committed self-dissection within 72 hours   
 Test Subject AT-0023 attempted to bargain for another’s life — the other subject was revived, but both died simultaneously of brain hemorrhage   

**LD-010 was recorded saying:**   
“Oh, reviving the dead? No problem at all—but you should be more detailed about what you want. I did revive her, but you didn’t say for how long. Haha.”   
She then disappeared.   

**Containment Protocol**   
LD-010 is not physically containable. However, psychological resistance training has shown mild success. AT-Class subjects exposed to pre-briefed deception matrices are more likely to resist the anomaly’s offers.   

**Ongoing protocol includes:**   

Deployment of cognitive dampeners in suspected interaction zones   

Immediate extraction of any marked individual   

Isolation and neutralization of gifted objects   

Recording and transcription of all verbal exchanges   

Any new phrases or sigils discovered should be submitted to the DIVIDE Linguistics Vault.   

**Internal Note**   
“She isn’t selling anything. She’s buying.”   
“Every ‘yes’ strengthens her form. Every ‘no’ makes her smile wider.”
