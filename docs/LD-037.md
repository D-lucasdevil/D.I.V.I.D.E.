**Description**:  
LD-037 is an anomalous VHS tape resembling a children’s educational program. The content initially appears cheerful and cartoonish, but quickly grows disturbing if the viewer refuses to interact or “cooperate” with its instructions. Non-compliance escalates the tape’s content, eventually culminating in the manifestation of a hostile, semi-corporeal entity.  

Once the episode concludes, or after significant disobedience by the viewer, the entity manifests within the vicinity and relentlessly targets the last individual to observe the footage. If the tape is turned off mid-playback or destroyed while active, partial manifestation may still occur, often resulting in localized anomalies or psychological trauma.  

**Known Effects**:  

The show encourages viewer interaction through commands, questions, and challenges.  

Lack of compliance results in audio/visual distortions, subliminal messaging, and eventually grotesque imagery.  

Completion of the full tape (approx. 11 minutes) without full compliance results in full entity manifestation.  

The manifested entity displays significant aggression, targeting the viewer with intent to kill.  

Entity requires approximately 140 direct hits with 7.64mm rounds to be neutralized.  

**Containment Procedures**:  

LD-037 is to remain locked within a lead-lined, fireproof media safe in Vault-37.  

No staff is to play or digitize the contents outside of approved testing procedures.  

Tests involving LD-037 must be overseen by AT-Class personnel and approved by Site Command.  

A full containment response team is to be on standby during any playback.  

Should a manifestation event begin, immediate neutralization protocol using high-caliber munitions is authorized.  

Under no circumstances is LD-037 to be copied, streamed, or converted to digital format.
