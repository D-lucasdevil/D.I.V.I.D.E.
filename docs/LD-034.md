**Overview**:   
LD-034, colloquially known as “The Pale Man,” is a humanoid entity characterized by unnaturally pale skin that appears excessively loose in proportion to its frame. Its most distinct and disturbing feature is its permanently stretched, straight-lipped smile that shows no muscular movement or expression, regardless of behavior or situation.  

The entity only appears after sunset, typically manifesting outside residential homes where a lone inhabitant is present. It remains motionless, standing still and staring through windows for extended periods—sometimes for days.  

If the occupant notices LD-034 but remains in the residence for over 7 consecutive nights, LD-034 enters a Berserk Phase and violently breaches the property. During this phase, it exhibits extreme aggression, targeting all biological life in the vicinity with indiscriminate lethal force.  

**Combat Resistance**:   
LD-034 has shown extraordinary durability, surviving:   

1600+ rounds of 7.62mm ammunition  

Close-quarters explosive charges  
 
High-velocity kinetic impact tests  

A notable engagement involved a specialized 18-man military unit deployed to neutralize LD-034. All operatives were killed with no observable damage inflicted on the entity.   

LD-034 was eventually subdued by Echo-9 Task Force, who held out until sunrise, at which point the entity entered a dormant state and ceased movement. This weakness to direct sunlight is currently the only known exploitable vulnerability. Controlled experiments have confirmed intense solar exposure and extreme temperatures can cause observable tissue breakdown.  

**Current Containment**:
LD-034 is currently secured in Sector 77 — Deep Cell 4, a reinforced subterranean chamber designed to:   

Eliminate all light stimuli  

Prevent physical breach or egress  

Withstand internal temperature spikes  

The entity does not require sustenance and exhibits passive behavior while sealed. It occasionally paces the room or stares at the walls, but does not initiate aggression unless the chamber is entered.  

Note: Direct physical presence inside the containment unit is forbidden. Remote observation only.  

**Kill Conditions**:  
Point-blank nuclear detonation  

Extreme prolonged exposure to concentrated sunlight or thermal plasma  

These are considered viable termination methods, pending ethics and environmental risk analysis.  

**Incident Log Summary**:  
Confirmed Kills: 18 civilians & operatives  

Damage Inflicted: Severe structural compromise to 3 residential blocks, 1 field compound  

Pulse Detected: Type III, originating in [REDACTED] Suburban Zone  

Reclassification Pending: If further adaptive abilities or regenerative traits are observed, LD-034 will be escalated to Class IV threat level.    

“It just stood there smiling. We emptied magazines into its chest, and it didn’t even flinch. It waited for us to run out before it moved.”
