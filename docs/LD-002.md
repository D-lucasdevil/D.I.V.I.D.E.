## Overview:
Subject LD-002, known as Doro, is an origin-class anomaly within the D.I.V.I.D.E. facility. [REDACTED] suggests Doro’s nature transcends that of normal entities contained within D.I.V.I.D.E., though full documentation is severely limited due to her unpredictable [DATA EXPUNGED].

Doro’s presence has resulted in significant temporal and dimensional disruptions, each instance more chaotic than the last. [REDACTED] reports indicate that her ability to manipulate reality on a whim often results in catastrophic events — both within and outside the facility.

Her connection to LD-001 (“The Chained One”) suggests a higher, more complex [REDACTED] that binds them both together, though the full nature of this link remains [DATA EXPUNGED].

LD-002 has multiple form her agressive forms witch was caught on camera or her normal calm form where she appears as a cute pet or a plushie more forms are highly likely.

When LD-002 warped her body into a realistic one from her "drawn" version she instantly went on the offensive and devoured [REDACTED] captain of [REDACTED] than went instantly back to her cartoon form.

LD-002 does not need to eat at all or drink there seem to be no needs for her survival other than entertainment.

## Notes:
Subject Doro’s powers have been recorded to do the following:

- **Dimensional Corruption:** [DATA EXPUNGED]. Doro’s [REDACTED] ability causes [REDACTED] that lead to random [REDACTED] phenomena within the facility, summoning additional anomalies.
  
- **Glitch Manifestation:** Doro has been observed [REDACTED] as she [DATA EXPUNGED] the fabric of space-time itself, leaving behind a [REDACTED] that continues to disrupt [REDACTED].

- **Perception Warping:** Those in proximity to Doro report disorientation and [REDACTED] visions. These disturbances [DATA EXPUNGED] and can cause long-term [REDACTED] on those exposed for prolonged periods.

- **Divine Surge:** Subject Doro has demonstrated a [REDACTED] power surge that temporarily [DATA EXPUNGED], often leaving [REDACTED] in her wake. This surge is believed to be linked to her [REDACTED].

[REDACTED]  
Doro’s connection to LD-001 remains an enigma. While [REDACTED] hints at some shared [DATA EXPUNGED], the [REDACTED] connection between them has yet to be fully understood. It is [REDACTED] that [REDACTED] remain consistent after each of Doro’s unexpected [DATA EXPUNGED].

## Known Connections:
- **LD-001** — “The Chained One” (Lucas Devil)  
- [REDACTED] — "D"
