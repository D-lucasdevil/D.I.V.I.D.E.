"Thermal image shows subject partially submerged in larval biomass. Immediate area remains at 1800°C to suppress reproductive activity."  

**Description**  
LD-013, also known as “The Insect Matron,” is a towering, emaciated humanoid organism fused with a biomechanical hive structure. Her skin is coated in hardened black chitin; her limbs are grotesquely elongated; her abdomen swells and pulses like a living nest.  

She exhibits near-immortal regenerative abilities, terrifying adaptability, and control over insect lifeforms in a 500-meter radius. LD-013 can mutate insects to extreme, biologically impossible sizes—documented cases include:  

Centipedes the size of large dogs  

Spiders with six-foot leg spans  

Fist-sized leeches  

Mosquitoes capable of draining adult humans within seconds  

**Known Capabilities**  

Insect Domination: Direct control over any insectoid organism within range  

Mutation Burst: Instantaneously mutates surrounding insects into monstrous versions  

Subterranean Hive-Weaving: Burrows and creates entire tunnel systems, expanding territory undetected  

City-Sized Nest Growth: Can build massive hives underground, spreading upward in months  

Insane Regeneration: Survives thousands of rounds; regenerates limbs within 30 minutes  

Extreme Speed and Reflexes: Evades most conventional weapons without slowing  

Mimicry and Pheromonal Control: Lures victims with voice imitation and chemical triggers  

**Containment Protocol**  
Currently contained in Thermal Suppression Chamber Theta-6, where temperatures remain above 1800°C to ensure no insect life survives and no egg production occurs. She is in a permanent burning state.  

Attempts at communication have failed. She has refused all cooperation and has made repeated escape attempts using redirected swarms and tunneling strategies.  

Use of incendiary rounds, flamethrowers, napalm, and area-wide firebombing has proven effective in driving her back.  
While ballistic missiles were once deployed, she used swarms to intercept them mid-flight, rendering their use inefficient and high-risk.  

She is to be kept alive only for research purposes. Upon conclusion of studies, immediate termination has been authorized.  

**Internal Note**  
"She doesn’t build a hive. She builds an ecosystem. Burn it, or we become part of it."
