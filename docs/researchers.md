# D.I.V.I.D.E. Research Division — Personnel File

**Designation:** Researcher  
**Clearance Level:** Ranges from Level 1 to Level 7 (higher for [REDACTED])  
**Nickname(s):** “White Coats,” “The Brains,” “Corpse Counters”

## Overview

D.I.V.I.D.E. Researchers are the scientific backbone of the organization — responsible for analyzing, understanding, and occasionally reverse-engineering anomalous phenomena. Operating in tightly controlled environments, these individuals serve as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and frontline application.

Though rarely seen outside containment zones or deep labs, their decisions directly impact field protocols, weaponization strategies, and survival rates for entire task forces. One wrong calculation, and it’s not just the test subject that dies — it’s the entire city... or in extremely rare, catastrophic cases, an entire country.

## Responsibilities

- Conducting in-depth analysis of anomalies, infection vectors, psychic influence zones, and spatial-temporal instability.  
- Designing containment protocols for new and evolving threats.  
- Overseeing AT-Class test operations and reviewing post-field reports.  
- Developing prototype countermeasures and anomaly-interfacing tech for Task Forces and A.P.A. units.  
- Reporting directly to higher-ranking Researchers; however, D.I.V.I.D.E. Overseers (if present) are to be prioritized and briefed before any other clearance level.

## Internal Culture

D.I.V.I.D.E. researchers are often cold, clinical, and disturbingly desensitized. Years of exposure to grotesque outcomes and existential threats have stripped away much of their emotional response. A screaming AT-Class subject isn’t a tragedy — it’s “data in motion.”

Departments quietly compete for results and recognition. Discoveries that influence protocol or containment methods earn greater funding and access. Ethics exist, but mostly as a formality.

## Classification Tiers

- **Junior Researchers (L1–2):** Monitor experiments, review logs, manage minor anomaly interactions.  
- **Field Analysts (L3):** Occasionally accompany armed squads to document anomaly behavior during controlled missions.  
- **Senior Researchers (L4):** Oversee full labs, supervise AT-Class experimentation, and author containment proposals.  
- **Project Leads (L5–6):** Architect entire containment facilities, advise APA deployments, and authorize emergency lockdowns.  
- **[REDACTED] (L7+):** Unknown. Limited references exist. Their clearance supersedes all personnel on-site.
