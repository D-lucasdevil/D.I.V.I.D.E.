**File: LD-035.5 — “??? (Unconfirmed Anomaly)”**  
**Designation**: Unknown Entity / Pulse-Origin Signature  
**Threat Level**: Pending Assessment  
**Containment Status**: No Direct Contact / Under Observation  
**Clearance Level**: DIVIDE Level 2+ Required  
**Pulse Level**: 2  

**Overview**:  
On ██/██/████ at exactly 03:17 AM UTC, a Pulse-Level 2 reality rupture was recorded originating from coordinates [REDACTED], a remote mountainous region with no prior anomaly activity. The pulse was detected across three Foundation monitoring satellites, with distortion signatures resembling those of known Class II anomalies — though no entity, structure, or dimensional rift has yet been located at the origin site.  

Despite extensive scans, field investigations, and drone surveillance, no visual confirmation or environmental alterations have been documented. Audio sensors recorded a 4-second burst of incomprehensible vocalizations overlapping with static, followed by silence. No local civilians reported unusual activity.  

This event has been catalogued under Anomaly Placeholder LD-035.5 and will remain under provisional observation until physical manifestation or further data is obtained.  

**Notes**:  
 
Due to the nature of pulse anomalies, it is presumed that LD-035.5 has entered our dimension, but is either non-corporeal, cloaked, or unwilling to reveal itself.  

Field teams have been advised to report any minor distortions, unexplainable emotional shifts, or missing time events within a 50 km radius of [REDACTED].
