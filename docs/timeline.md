Here’s a chronological account of key events in the D.I.V.I.D.E. universe:

## Year 2005: The First Anomaly Was Recorded
The first anomaly was discovered in 2005, leading to the establishment of D.I.V.I.D.E. (Dimensional Investigation, Verification, and Eradication). This marked the beginning of an unprecedented series of events that would shape the future of humanity.

## Year 2022: The Doro Entity Was First Sighted
In 2022, the first documented sighting of the mysterious "Doro" entity, also referred to as LD-002, was reported. This event marked the emergence of an unsettling force that would become a cornerstone of D.I.V.I.D.E.’s research.

## Year 2023: Glitches Begin to Appear in the Timeline
As reality itself began to warp, anomalies became more frequent. Glitches in the fabric of time and space became more noticeable, with LD-002 appearing more often and causing widespread confusion and fear.

## Year 2025: The D.I.V.I.D.E. Incident Escalates
A surge in the appearance of anomalies spread across the solar system, with reports of strange and dangerous phenomena increasing exponentially. This event seems to correlate with the ongoing research and developments around LD-001.
