**File: LD-031 — “First Bottle’s Free”**  
**Classification**: Addiction-Class Anomaly  
**Threat Level**: Class II (Psychological hazard, risk of spread)  
**Containment Status**: Secured / Biohazard Containment Locker  
**Clearance Level**: DIVIDE Level 3+ Required  








**Description**:  
LD-031, colloquially referred to as “First Bottle’s Free,” is a dark glass bottle resembling a high-end whiskey brand. The label is faded and unreadable, and the cap appears fused to the bottle — yet the liquid within can still be poured by tilting. Chemical analysis has yielded no known results; the contents do not match any Earth-based substance.  

Upon ingestion (even a single drop), the affected individual develops an instantaneous and irreversible addiction to alcohol, escalating rapidly to extreme dependency. This addiction bypasses all known chemical tolerance levels and psychological thresholds. Victims will become consumed with acquiring and consuming any form of alcohol, showing full withdrawal symptoms within minutes of abstinence.  

Behavioral Effects of Exposure:  

**Initial stage**: Euphoric calm, increased sociability (approx. 2 minutes).  

**Secondary stage**: Craving all alcoholic substances, including non-consumables like hand sanitizer or industrial ethanol.  

**Final stage**: Without access to alcohol, subject will become violently unstable, irrational, and will attempt to escape containment or assault staff to acquire more.    

**Long-Term Effects**:  

Psychological deterioration  

Liver failure accelerated by 500%  

Cognitive and social regression  
 
Total self-identity collapse (after 48-72 hours untreated)  

**Termination of the effect**:  
There is no known cure. Psychological therapy, sedation, and memory wipes have failed in all tests. D-class test subjects who survive more than 3 days are placed on monitored alcohol dosing cycles until they expire or are terminated.  

**Containment Protocol**:  
LD-031 is stored in a high-security biomaterial vault at Site-5, within a triple-sealed hazardous item locker. Interaction is only permitted under testing conditions, with Level 3 clearance and higher. Exposure must be approved by the Psychotropic Hazard Board and observed via remote systems only.  

Personnel experiencing cravings following exposure must be sedated and quarantined immediately.  

**Internal Note**:  
"It doesn’t matter if it’s vodka, rum, or cheap wine from a gas station. Once you drink from LD-031, you’ll want all of it. Every kind of alcohol. Forever. We had a subject try to distill ethanol from cleaning supplies in under 6 hours. Died smiling."
