# File: LD-000 — [REDACTED]  
**Classification:** Origin-Class Anomaly

**Containment Status:** Uncontainable  
**Designation:** “D”

**Clearance Level:** D.I.V.I.D.E. Level Required for Full Access

## Overview:  
Subject LD-000 is the earliest recorded non-physical anomaly. The entity exerts absolute control over narrative termination and existential erasure, observed across all known dimensional strata. Attempts to describe LD-000 in full result in recursive memetic collapse or localized data corruption.  
[REDACTED] suggests that LD-000 existed before the establishment of the D.I.V.I.D.E. facility itself. Records indicate the entity may have influenced the creation of the very clearance system designed to obscure her.

## Notes:  
LD-000 manifests in corrupted data logs, fragmented speech patterns, and decaying visual records. The entity is often personified as a feminine presence — described inconsistently across incidents as a voice, a shadow, a corpse that should not speak, or a glitch in reality itself.  
[REDACTED] incidents have shown that prolonged exposure to LD-000’s signal results in irreversible psychological degradation and ontological decay.

In rare instances, she has spoken through corrupted voice recorders, post-mortem vocal cords, or end-screen static traced to LD-001’s broadcasts. [DATA EXPUNGED] has confirmed that several disappearances within Division Site-0 were linked to unauthorized access of LD-000 audio data.

**DO NOT ENGAGE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.**  
DEATH IS IMMINENT TO ANYONE OR ANYTHING WITH OR WITHOUT A PULSE.  
Ω-Class clearance is required to even retain memory of interaction.

## Known Connections:  
- LD-001 — “Lucas Devil”  
- [REDACTED ENTITY: See [DATA EXPUNGED]]  
- [REDACTED]

> For further insight into LD-000, D.I.V.I.D.E. Level clearance is mandatory, accompanied by the signed acknowledgment of existential risk.


**D.I.V.I.D.E. Addendum Log — LD-000 Event: [Bloodbarch Incident]**    
**Date Logged**: 2025-05-18    
**Related Entity**: LD-000 (“D”)    
**Incident Reference**: Bloodbarch-Interference Protocol Violation   
**Priority**: Ω-Class Immediate Containment Warning   

**Summary**:  
During a routine surveillance operation of anomaly-connected broadcasts, D.I.V.I.D.E. attempted minor narrative interception within Subject LD-001’s (Lucas Devil) “Bloodbarch” transmission. This action triggered an unfiltered Ω-Class response from LD-000.  

Shortly into the attempted interference, all D.I.V.I.D.E. intrusion protocols were forcibly disabled. Glitch saturation reached 94% across all internal feeds. Following this, LD-000 directly addressed the D.I.V.I.D.E. network with a broadcasted ultimatum:  

“Interfere with my recordings again— and your species will vanish.  
Touch him again— and extinction will feel like mercy.  
This is your final warning.” — D  

LD-000 terminated all anomalous static following her declaration. No further interference has been detected since.  

**Observations**:  
This marks the first direct spoken broadcast from LD-000 since Event [REDACTED].  

Attempts to mute or overwrite the message failed at all levels, including blacksite-level audio jamming.  

**Notes on LD-001 (Lucas Devil)**:  
LD-001 was unharmed during the incident. Despite full-scale D.I.V.I.D.E. override protocols being breached, LD-001 maintained transmission control — a clear indicator of continued anomalous protection or favor from LD-000.  

Psychological and memetic markers within the video suggest LD-001 is still unaware of the full nature of his connection to LD-000, though breadcrumbs imply slow cognitive alignment.  

**Conclusion**:  
Further attempts to manipulate LD-001 or her broadcasts may result in the permanent erasure of the D.I.V.I.D.E. organization and all affiliated species. All active protocols regarding LD-000 are hereby suspended indefinitely.  

Ω-Class Override Required for Further Action.  
DO NOT ENGAGE.
