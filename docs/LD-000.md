# File: LD-000 — [REDACTED]  
**Classification:** Origin-Class Anomaly  
**Threat Level:** Ω / [DATA EXPUNGED]  
**Containment Status:** Uncontainable  
**Designation:** “D”

**Clearance Level:** D.I.V.I.D.E. Level Required for Full Access

## Overview:  
Subject LD-000 is the earliest recorded non-physical anomaly. The entity exerts absolute control over narrative termination and existential erasure, observed across all known dimensional strata. Attempts to describe LD-000 in full result in recursive memetic collapse or localized data corruption.  
[REDACTED] suggests that LD-000 existed before the establishment of the D.I.V.I.D.E. facility itself. Records indicate the entity may have influenced the creation of the very clearance system designed to obscure her.

## Notes:  
LD-000 manifests in corrupted data logs, fragmented speech patterns, and decaying visual records. The entity is often personified as a feminine presence — described inconsistently across incidents as a voice, a shadow, a corpse that should not speak, or a glitch in reality itself.  
[REDACTED] incidents have shown that prolonged exposure to LD-000’s signal results in irreversible psychological degradation and ontological decay.

In rare instances, she has spoken through corrupted voice recorders, post-mortem vocal cords, or end-screen static traced to LD-001’s broadcasts. [DATA EXPUNGED] has confirmed that several disappearances within Division Site-0 were linked to unauthorized access of LD-000 audio data.

**DO NOT ENGAGE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.**  
DEATH IS IMMINENT TO ANYONE OR ANYTHING WITH OR WITHOUT A PULSE.  
Ω-Class clearance is required to even retain memory of interaction.

## Known Connections:

> For further insight into LD-000, D.I.V.I.D.E. Level clearance is mandatory, accompanied by the signed acknowledgment of existential risk.


**D.I.V.I.D.E. Addendum Log — LD-000 Event: [Bloodbarch Incident]**    
**Date Logged**: 2025-05-18    
**Related Entity**: LD-000 (“D”)    
**Incident Reference**: Bloodbarch-Interference Protocol Violation   
**Priority**: Ω-Class Immediate Containment Warning   

**Summary**:    
During LD-001's recent traversal into the Bloodbarch anomaly world, a routine surveillance intercept was attempted by D.I.V.I.D.E. analysts. The signal interference was immediately suppressed by LD-000, who forcibly terminated all access channels and issued a direct threat to all active D.I.V.I.D.E. nodes.  

LD-000's message was transmitted across corrupted static and accompanied by visual and auditory data collapse. The statement issued is as follows:   

"D.I.V.I.D.E. attempted to breach my domain.  
This is a warning to all species... and to D.I.V.I.D.E.:  
Interfere with my recordings again — and your species will vanish.  
Touch him again — and extinction will feel like mercy.  
This is your final warning.  
—D"  

**Result**:  
All interception attempts ceased instantly. LD-000 maintained dominion over the full duration of LD-001’s exposure to the anomaly. No further engagement has been authorized. Omega-Level lockdown initiated across all narrative interface nodes.  

**Classification Update**:  
LD-000 now confirmed to possess sentient awareness of D.I.V.I.D.E.’s actions in real-time.  
Engagement protocols updated: AUTOMATIC NULLIFICATION ON CONTACT.  
D.I.V.I.D.E. researchers are to avoid all tampering with anomaly-linked transmissions until further notice. Survival rate drops to 0.3% upon unauthorized interaction.  
   
LD-000 terminated all anomalous static following her declaration. No further interference has been detected since.   
 
**Observations**:  
This marks the first direct spoken broadcast from LD-000 since Event [REDACTED].  

Attempts to mute or overwrite the message failed at all levels, including blacksite-level audio jamming.  

**Notes on LD-001 (Lucas Devil)**:  
LD-001 was unharmed during the incident. Despite full-scale D.I.V.I.D.E. override protocols being breached, LD-001 maintained transmission control — a clear indicator of continued anomalous protection or favor from LD-000.  

Psychological and memetic markers within the video suggest LD-001 is still unaware of the full nature of his connection to LD-000, though breadcrumbs imply slow cognitive alignment.  

**Conclusion**:  
Further attempts to manipulate LD-001 or her broadcasts may result in the permanent erasure of the D.I.V.I.D.E. organization and all affiliated species. All active protocols regarding LD-000 are hereby suspended indefinitely.  

Ω-Class Override Required for Further Action.  
DO NOT ENGAGE.
