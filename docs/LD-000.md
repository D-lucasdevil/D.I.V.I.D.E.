# File: LD-000 — [REDACTED]

**Classification:** Origin-Class Anomaly  
**Threat Level:** Ω / [DATA EXPUNGED]  
**Containment Status:** Uncontainable  
**Designation:** “D”

---

### **Overview:**
Subject **LD-000** is the earliest recorded non-physical anomaly. The entity exerts absolute control over narrative termination and existential erasure, observed across all known dimensional strata. Attempts to describe **LD-000** in full result in recursive memetic collapse or localized data corruption.

---

### **Notes:**
**LD-000** manifests in corrupted data logs, fragmented speech patterns, and decaying visual records. The entity is often personified as a feminine presence — described inconsistently across incidents as a voice, a shadow, a corpse that should not speak, or a glitch in reality itself.

In rare instances, she has spoken through corrupted voice recorders, post-mortem vocal cords, or end-screen static traced to **LD-001**’s broadcasts.

**DO NOT ENGAGE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. DEATH IS IMMINENT TO ANYONE OR ANYTHING WITH OR WITHOUT A PULSE.**
