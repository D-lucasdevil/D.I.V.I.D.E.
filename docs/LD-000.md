# File: LD-000 — [REDACTED]  
**Classification:** Origin-Class Anomaly  
**Threat Level:** Ω / [DATA EXPUNGED]  
**Containment Status:** Uncontainable  
**Designation:** “D”

## Overview:  
Subject LD-000 is the earliest recorded non-physical anomaly. The entity exerts absolute control over narrative termination and existential erasure, observed across all known dimensional strata. Attempts to describe LD-000 in full result in recursive memetic collapse or localized data corruption.  
[REDACTED] suggests that LD-000 existed before the establishment of the D.I.V.I.D.E. facility itself. Records indicate the entity may have influenced the creation of the very clearance system designed to obscure her.

## Notes:  
LD-000 manifests in corrupted data logs, fragmented speech patterns, and decaying visual records. The entity is often personified as a feminine presence — described inconsistently across incidents as a voice, a shadow, a corpse that should not speak, or a glitch in reality itself.  
[REDACTED] incidents have shown that prolonged exposure to LD-000’s signal results in irreversible psychological degradation and ontological decay.

In rare instances, she has spoken through corrupted voice recorders, post-mortem vocal cords, or end-screen static traced to LD-001’s broadcasts. [DATA EXPUNGED] has confirmed that several disappearances within Division Site-0 were linked to unauthorized access of LD-000 audio data.

**DO NOT ENGAGE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.**  
DEATH IS IMMINENT TO ANYONE OR ANYTHING WITH OR WITHOUT A PULSE.  
Ω-Class clearance is required to even retain memory of interaction.

> For further insight into LD-000, D.I.V.I.D.E. Level clearance is mandatory, accompanied by the signed acknowledgment of existential risk.
