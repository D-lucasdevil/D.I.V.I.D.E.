**Description**:  
LD-039 is a black rotary telephone with no visible brand or manufacturer marks. Despite lacking a power source or signal connection, LD-039 is always functional.  

**Behavioral Properties**:  

If dialed by a psychologically stable individual, LD-039 will immediately hang up without further effect.  

If dialed by a person exhibiting suicidal ideation or severe emotional instability, LD-039 activates and begins a multi-stage anomalous sequence:  

**Encounter Phases**:  
**First Call (Trigger Phase)**:  
The caller is instantaneously transported to a vast, dimly-lit chamber, standing before a 5-meter-tall automaton resembling a grotesque wooden nutcracker. The figure initiates a randomized 1-in-6 chance lethal event. If the subject dies, their body reappears where they stood before dialing, showing massive cranial trauma. If they survive, they are returned unharmed—physically.  

**Second Call (Pursuit Phase)**:  
Caller is transported again. This time, the nutcracker animates and begins to hunt the caller through a surreal version of their own home or a warped childhood memory.  

If the caller stops moving, the nutcracker executes them.  

If the caller keeps running for approximately 9 minutes, they awaken in their original location, highly distressed but alive.  

**Third Call (Transition Phase)**:  
Caller is transported in front of LD-019, an entirely separate anomaly (see file: LD-019 — “The Game Host”).  
 
If the subject agrees to play LD-019’s game, they are locked out of ever calling LD-039 again.  

If they refuse, return, and attempt a fourth call, LD-039 will instantaneously cause cerebral hemorrhaging, killing the caller within 0.2 seconds.  

**Containment Protocol**:  
LD-039 is kept under triple biometric lock inside Vault-39, sealed within a lead-lined phone booth. Only authorized testing personnel are allowed to interact, and all tests must be approved by DIVIDE Command and overseen by a trauma psychologist.  

Psych evaluation mandatory post-testing. Test subjects are to be monitored for long-term PTSD, hallucinations, and compulsive re-contact attempts.  

**Additional Notes**:  
LD-039 seems capable of detecting intent remotely, suggesting semi-sentient behavior.  

Its connection to LD-019 implies possible networked intelligence among anomalies post-Pulse.
