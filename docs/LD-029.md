**Description**:  
LD-029 is a handheld camera resembling a vintage flash camera, though it lacks any internal components related to photography. Pressing the shutter emits an intense burst of white light capable of stunning all individuals within a 5-meter radius. Affected individuals experience complete blindness for approximately 3 seconds, followed by heavy disorientation and motor delay for up to 8 seconds.  

LD-029 requires 5 seconds to recharge between flashes and emits a soft mechanical winding sound during its cooldown. The device cannot be destroyed through conventional means, including incineration, crushing, or chemical degradation. Attempts to dismantle LD-029 have resulted in internal parts resetting themselves or vanishing altogether.
