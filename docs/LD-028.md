(Yeah. It’s literally a goddamn UFO. Taken in secured hangar.)  

**Description**  
LD-028 is an actual flying saucer. Not metaphorically. It’s a full-ass, chrome-plated, interstellar spacecraft found abandoned in a remote mountainous region. No life signs were detected. Forensics suggest the original occupants (presumably aliens) either died fighting something or were killed before discovery.  

The ship is intact, operational, and looks like something out of 1960s paranoia-fueled sci-fi—except it’s real and its systems are far more advanced than anything humanity has achieved. It can fly. It can shoot. It can apparently cloak. That’s why it’s locked the hell down.  

**Strange Behavior**  

Makes weird internal “whispers” and system hums with no known source  

Shifts internal geometry (slightly) when no one’s watching  

Outer hull is nearly indestructible  

Can activate autonomously for brief periods  

Emits occasional distress signals in unknown frequencies  

**Containment Protocol**  

Housed in Sub-Level Hangar 9, behind triple-lock magnetic fields  

All power cores removed and sealed separately  

Entry prohibited unless under emergency review by 2+ Level 4 personnel  

Weekly scans for reactivation signals  

**Notes**  

“We’re calling it what it is. It’s a f**king UFO. And it's staying in the hangar until we figure out if it wants to kill us or help us leave this rock.”
