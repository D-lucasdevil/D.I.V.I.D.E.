**Description**  
LD-028 is an operational extraterrestrial spacecraft of unknown origin, currently empty of any biological life. Evidence suggests all alien occupants were eliminated prior to discovery. The vessel retains full functionality, including propulsion, internal systems, and defensive capabilities, though all weapons have been disabled for containment purposes.  

The ship’s interior features advanced technology beyond current human understanding, with numerous consoles and panels still active. Despite the absence of living occupants, the vessel emits occasional unexplained energy surges and faint, ghostly sounds within its corridors.
