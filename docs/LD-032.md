**Description**:  
LD-032, nicknamed “Free Parking,” refers to a rusted and weather-worn parking booth located at an abandoned multi-level lot in ████████, Germany. The booth superficially appears non-anomalous but has been linked to eight fatal incidents, all involving individuals who entered and remained inside it for longer than 30 seconds.  

Once a subject enters LD-032 and remains inside, they begin to experience escalating paranormal phenomena over the course of several minutes. These include:  

Sudden radio static or voices from unplugged equipment  

Cold drafts and visual hallucinations (apparitions, flickers, shadow movement)  

Emotional manipulation including dread, guilt, or panic  

High-pitched auditory hallucinations similar to car horns or screeching tires  

The anomaly culminates upon the subject exiting the booth. Within 2 to 5 seconds of leaving the structure, a full-sized car — typically a rusted sedan or pickup truck with no license plates — will manifest midair and fall directly onto the subject, resulting in instant death in 100% of known cases. The vehicle disappears minutes after the fatality unless manually restrained.  

Attempts to remove, relocate, or destroy LD-032 have all failed due to unexplained mechanical failures, missing equipment, or spontaneous electrical surges near the object.  

**Behavioral Traits**:  

**Delayed Lethality**: No harm is done until the subject exits the booth, encouraging longer exposure.  

**Manifestation Triggered by Fear**: The more fear displayed inside the booth, the more violent and dramatic the haunting becomes.  

No Identified Source Entity: Unlike other haunting anomalies, no “ghost” or singular spirit has been detected. It may be location-bound or even non-sentient in nature.  

**Containment Protocol**:  
The area surrounding LD-032 is to be walled off and monitored 24/7 via drone surveillance. No one is to enter the booth under any circumstance without pre-approved D.I.V.I.D.E. authorization and Level 3 cognitive hazard gear.  

Signs reading “STRUCTURALLY UNSTABLE – DO NOT ENTER” are to be maintained around the perimeter. All footage of public deaths linked to LD-032 has been scrubbed from the internet under Operation [REDACTED].  

If germany were to ever enter a state of war attempt to destroy LD-032 with nuclear warheads has been aproved no matter what the casualties.

**Internal Note:**  
“Why a car? Why that booth? We’ve had anomalies with ghosts, time loops, even talking corpses. But this thing doesn’t talk. It doesn’t want. It just waits. I stood ten meters away and still felt my teeth hurt.”
