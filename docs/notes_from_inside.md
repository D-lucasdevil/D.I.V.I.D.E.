Anomaly Classification System:
1. Class I – Low Threat
Description: Minimal risk, typically stable and harmless anomalies.

Example: A benign entity that doesn't alter its environment or pose significant danger unless provoked.

2. Class II – Moderate Threat
Description: Some risk, though manageable with standard containment and procedures.

Example: An entity that exhibits defensive or reactive behavior under certain circumstances.

3. Class III – High Threat
Description: Potential for danger if mishandled; anomalies that require strict monitoring and safety protocols.

Example: An entity capable of causing harm through direct action or manipulating its environment in dangerous ways.

4. Class IV – Extreme Threat
Description: Significant risk to personnel and environment; requires specialized containment and close monitoring at all times.

Example: An anomaly capable of altering environmental factors or reality within a confined space.

5. Class V – Catastrophic Threat
Description: These anomalies present a threat of destruction on a large scale, either affecting the foundation or reality itself. Full understanding of the entity may not be possible.

Example: A reality-warping entity that can erase or alter memories, time, or even existence on a grand scale.

6. Class VI – Omega-Class Threat 
Description:  anomalies represent the most extreme threats known to the Foundation. These entities are capable of overwhelming large-scale destruction, manipulating fundamental aspects of reality, and causing chaos across dimensions. Their power is limitless, and their abilities exceed the scope of normal classification systems.

7. Class Ω - The end
Description: There is nothing you can do. We are all dead.

Abilities: Ω-Class anomalies are uncontainable, capable of reshaping time, space, and reality itself. Their influence extends far beyond the physical realm, and they are often considered apocalyptic in nature.

Containment: Impossible. These anomalies exist on a level where containment is beyond all understanding or technology, as they defy the fundamental laws of the universe.

Example:

Anomaly Ω-01: A being whose presence can collapse entire galaxies, alter timelines, or erase life from existence.

Anomaly Ω-02: A cosmic entity that controls life and death across multiple dimensions, able to create and destroy universes with a thought.

Ω-Class (Beyond Class VI) – Ultimate Power
Description: Ω-Class anomalies exist beyond the scope of even Class VI. They are not bound by the conventional laws of physics, time, or space. These entities are the epitome of existence, representing the highest force or being that can possibly exist in all of reality.

Abilities: They can control life, death, and reality itself. Their power transcends even that of gods or cosmic forces, existing on a metaphysical level that defies any conceivable containment. Their motives or behavior may be entirely unknowable to us, as their understanding of existence may be beyond human comprehension.

Containment: There are no measures in place for containing Ω-Class entities. These anomalies exist as forces of nature themselves, or may even be the creators or destroyers of realities.

Example:

Anomaly Ω-01: A being that can create and destroy entire timelines, altering the very fabric of existence and rewriting reality on a whim.

Anomaly Ω-02: A cosmic entity that governs over life and death, whose actions influence every being and reality across multiple dimensions and beyond.

Redacted Anomalies 
Description: Entities that are either too dangerous, unknown, or classified as too great a threat to disclose. These anomalies are beyond containment and may fall under Ω-Class, but their exact nature remains sealed by the highest authorities.

Access: Only D.I.V.I.D.E. Level clearance holders have access to information regarding these anomalies.

Clearance Levels:
Level 1: Entry-Level Access
Description: Basic security and entry-level anomalies. Access to non-sensitive anomalies and public records.

Examples: General staff, researchers, and new personnel with basic access.

Level 2: Restricted Access
Description: Specific anomalies and sensitive areas. Limited access to dangerous or volatile entities.

Examples: Security personnel, certain researchers, and authorized technicians.

Level 3: Intermediate Access
Description: Common research and standard containment protocols. Full access to classified anomalies for those with moderate security clearance.

Examples: Researchers and containment staff working on routine but potentially dangerous anomalies.

Level 4: Advanced Access
Description: Involved with high-risk anomalies, restricted data, and classified operations. High-level access to anomalous entities that may require specialized containment.

Examples: Senior researchers, top-level security personnel, and department heads.

Level 5: Specialized Access
Description: Required for studying anomalies with dangerous or unknown properties. Access to the most complex and dangerous entities that need expert management.

Examples: Leading experts in anomaly research, specialized containment team leaders.

Level 6: Expert Access
Description: For top researchers and operatives with direct anomaly containment responsibilities. Access to the highest-level containment protocols and restricted materials.

Examples: High-ranking anomaly researchers and field operatives responsible for extreme containment tasks.

Level 7: Omega-Class Access 
Description: Access to the most dangerous or unknown entities, with full operational control. Includes command over the most volatile situations, involving catastrophic anomalies.

Examples: Top-level operatives with global influence over anomaly management and containment.

D.I.V.I.D.E. Access:
Description: D.I.V.I.D.E. clearance is the highest level of access, granting complete authority over all anomalies, including their execution, containment, and release. This clearance allows for full control over the foundation, including the activation of self-destruction protocols with the potential to set off 50 nuclear warheads simultaneously.

Abilities: With D.I.V.I.D.E. access, the holder can alter or release any anomaly without restrictions, override all containment protocols, and even authorize the foundation's self-destruction in the event of an apocalyptic scenario.

Level: There are no sub-levels. D.I.V.I.D.E. is a class above Level 7 and reserved for the highest authorities of the Foundation, often used in cases of existential crisis or global catastrophe.

Summary of Classification & Clearance System:
Class I - III: Anomalies that are manageable with standard or specialized containment measures.

Class IV - V: Entities of extreme risk that require constant monitoring, with potential reality-bending or destructive abilities.

Class VI: The highest known classification for a contained anomaly, where the entity represents an extreme threat, potentially affecting large-scale destruction and altering aspects of reality.

Ω-Class (Beyond Class VI): The ultimate class. These anomalies exceed the scope of anything classified by the Foundation, existing beyond all known physical or metaphysical constraints. They are capable of manipulating and controlling life, death, and reality itself. Only a select few would ever encounter an Ω-Class entity, and even then, their true nature would be beyond anything the Foundation could prepare for.

Redacted: Information suppressed for safety and secrecy. These anomalies may transcend our current understanding or be far too dangerous to even be classified.
