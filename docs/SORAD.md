**Task Force Designation: SORAD**  
**Full Name**: Special Oceanic Retrieval and Analysis Division  
**Classification**: Specialized Deep-Sea Anomaly Containment & Surveillance Unit  
**Clearance Level**: DIVIDE Level 4+ Required  

**Overview**:  
SORAD is a marine-specialized task force formed in response to deep-ocean Pulse signatures and aquatic anomaly activity. Operating out of Blackridge Naval Sub-Sector and deep-sea facility Outpost-Δ9, SORAD is responsible for detection, retrieval, surveillance, and containment of any anomaly or artifact that emerges, manifests, or pulses within oceanic zones.  

Due to the increasing number of Pulse anomalies near abyssal zones, trench systems, and continental shelves, SORAD's deployment is considered critical-level response whenever underwater phenomena are detected.  

**Primary Functions**:  
Track and investigate underwater Pulse activity.  

Secure and contain anomalies that breach into marine ecosystems or coastal areas.  

Maintain surveillance on known ocean-based anomalies and dead zones.  
 
Retrieve artifact-class or biological anomalies from ocean depths.  

Operate autonomous submersibles and combat-modified deep-sea suits.  

**Notable Equipment**:  
A.D.R.E.N.A Suits (Abyssal-Density Reinforced Environmental Navigation Armor)  
Allows operatives to survive depths exceeding 10,000 meters for short durations. Fully pressurized with reinforced armor plating and limited pulse shielding.  

**Nautilus-Class Retrieval Subs**  
Designed for silent insertion and anomaly extraction in deep-pressure zones. Equipped with long-range sensor arrays, Pulse detectors, and full containment pods.  

**Tidebreaker Pulse Anchors**  
Deployed around potential breach zones. Stabilizes Pulse energy fields and prevents aquatic anomalies from surfacing or migrating.  


**Known Deployments**:  
LD-037.5 – “The Drowned Pulse” (Presumed Destroyed)  

Artifact Recovery – Deep Trench Signal Echo ██ (Recovered 1 metallic anomaly)  

Coastal Interference Pulse ██ – Neutralized REDACTED  

**Clearance Notes**:  
Only DIVIDE Level 4+ personnel or those with marine specialization clearance are permitted to receive unredacted SORAD reports. Any breach of confidentiality will result in full mind-scrub protocol and deep-black disciplinary action.
