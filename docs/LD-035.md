**File: LD-035 — “The Wishing Matron”**    
**Designation**: Sentient Idol / Reality-Bending Artifact  
**Threat Level**: Class III  
**Containment Status**: Sealed in Vault-89  
**Clearance Level**: DIVIDE Level 4+ Required for Access  






**Description**:  
LD-035 is a 2-meter-tall porcelain doll resembling an elderly woman, with faded dress attire and lifeless, glassy eyes. It exhibits no mobility or speech unless directly interacted with. When approached by a subject willing to make a wish, LD-035 becomes animate and engages the subject in a hushed conversation. Wishes are granted selectively, primarily limited to physical or material desires such as wealth, luxury items, gold, diamonds, or classified items. LD-035 refuses to fulfill wishes that involve resurrection, external death, or mass destruction unless the requester explicitly wishes to die themselves.  

Upon wish fulfillment, the subject undergoes a violent and grotesque self-deformation process. This transformation is rapid, often resulting in the subject becoming an immobile "work of art" — typically a living sculpture, abstract flesh-formed painting, or decorative figure still faintly alive and conscious. Following this process, loud clapping is audibly projected in a 200-meter radius. Survivors within range often report permanent auditory hallucinations of the clapping, described as “echoing approval of a twisted gallery.”  

**Containment Procedures**:  
LD-035 is currently housed in Vault-89, located 89 floors beneath Site-77 in an isolated, lead-lined chamber equipped with one-way surveillance and triple-sealed airlocks. Access is restricted to Level 4+ clearance with DIVIDE override.  

To avoid spontaneous teleportation or external exposure, LD-035 requires a sacrificial subject once per month. These individuals are to be selected from approved Class D personnel and briefed under false pretenses. If the sacrifice condition is not met, LD-035 relocates to a random global location, resulting in unsanctioned public wish attempts and anomalous art events.  

LD-035 has demonstrated the ability to breach containment via reality-folding, particularly for retrieving item-class anomalies relevant to a wish. Surveillance and tracking of LD-035-linked wish events are ongoing.  

**Addendum 035-A**:  
Total Confirmed Wishes: 37  
Successful Containments After Breach: 4  
Known Survivor Count (Post-Wish): 0  

Note: Exposure to LD-035’s voice during the wish exchange triggers a cognitive pull effect. Personnel are advised never to enter within vocal range unless absolutely necessary.
