**Description**  
LD-022, referred to as “Bloodbarch,” is a tree species resembling a twisted, leafless oak, typically 4–6 meters tall. Its bark appears deeply cracked and soaked in a crimson hue, with pulsating vein-like grooves running up the trunk. When the tree is physically damaged—particularly when cut—it expels a high-pressure stream of blood-like fluid from the wound.  

This fluid is chemically and visually indistinguishable from human blood and contains psycho-reactive compounds that induce a compulsive effect in humans. Any individual coming into direct contact with the fluid experiences an overwhelming urge to return to the tree, regardless of distance, and ultimately kill themselves at its roots. This effect is believed to serve the tree’s need for organic matter, particularly blood and bone, as fertilizer.  

**Behavioral Traits**  
Bleeds heavily when cut, spraying blood-like fluid several meters  

Blood causes compulsive suicidal behavior in affected individuals  

Victims often vocalize the phrase “Feed the roots” before death  

Surrounding area is rich in decomposing human remains and anomalously fertile soil  

Cannot be relocated; attempts to dig it out result in new saplings growing overnight  

**Containment Protocol**  
LD-022’s primary specimen is surrounded by a reinforced exclusion zone within a quarantined forest region in [REDACTED]  

Observation towers equipped with remote sensors and automated deterrent systems  

No personnel may enter the active zone without Level 2 authorization and sealed suits  

Any fluid samples are to be incinerated immediately after testing  

Any attempts to cut, burn, or damage the tree are strictly forbidden
