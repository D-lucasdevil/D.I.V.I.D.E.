**Description**  
LD-027 is a standard late-2000s desktop computer, with no identifiable modifications to its hardware or physical structure. Its anomalous properties emerge only upon boot-up, where a black screen displays white serif text:  

“Would you like to summon an angel?”  

Operators are then prompted with a series of philosophical, moral, and metaphysical questions. These include choices like:  

“Would you sacrifice others to gain truth?”  

“Is purity found in obedience or resistance?”  

“Should power be earned, taken, or granted?”  

Depending on the specific combination of answers, the terminal will “summon” a unique angelic figure, displayed via static-drenched visual renders accompanied by low-frequency hums or reversed hymnal audio.  

These entities are not real angels. They are fabricated imitations, extremely degraded in appearance, and dangerously unstable. Each “angel” has a distinct name (e.g., Ahael, Baruel, Samayel) and sends forth a specific number of “shadows” to pursue the user.  

**Shadow Manifestations**  
Upon conclusion of the ritual, within 30 minutes, shadow entities will begin to appear near the summoner. These are vague humanoid figures, made of smoke and flickering static, with distorted limb proportions and low-tier aggression.  

Common summons: 1–5 shadows  

Rare trigger (Samayel route): 50–100 shadows, attacking in coordinated waves  

Shadows can be destroyed via conventional means (firearms, melee, electrical discharge)  

Shadows will disintegrate once the summoner dies or flees 5km from initial location  
 
No long-term tracking behavior observed  

**Containment Protocol**  
LD-027 is stored in a Faraday-shielded digital observation chamber, disconnected from all external networks.  

Power is provided via manual activation only  

Interaction permitted to Level 3+ personnel with Task Force AXIOM oversight  

All shadow manifestations must be neutralized in a designated kill zone  

Terminal is to be powered down immediately upon summoning trigger  

The hardware itself is non-anomalous and can be physically destroyed with ease. Destruction is on hold pending final analysis of summoning algorithm for any potentially profitable or reverse-engineerable information.  

**Internal Note**  

“It doesn’t summon angels. It generates trauma.”
