**Description**  
LD-026 appears to be a human woman in her mid-20s, of unknown origin, with long blond hair braided down her back, pale skin, and strikingly symmetrical facial features. Every observer — regardless of prior attraction preferences — describes her as “beautiful,” “ethereal,” or “irresistible,” particularly male subjects.  

LD-026 seeks out romantic partners and enters into relationships that initially appear loving, stable, and fulfilling. However, an anomalous compulsion rapidly develops in her chosen partner:  

Within weeks, the partner develops intense desire to cheat  

All other women appear dramatically more attractive to him  

This results in nearly guaranteed betrayal  

Once LD-026 learns of this (always within 48 hours of the act), she enters her ritualistic execution protocol:  

Murders both her partner and the individual they cheated with  

Prepares their bodies into gourmet-style meals  

A small boy, approximately 8 years old, materializes and delivers the food to local homes  

If anyone knocks on her door within 1 hour of delivery:  

LD-026 enters a berserk state  

Summons a kitchen knife from thin air  

Becomes extremely resistant to all damage (bullets, blades, fire, blunt trauma)  

Cannot be stopped until all perceived threats are dead or she collapses from exhaustion  

**Behavioral Traits**  
Highly intelligent and self-aware  

Expresses no remorse for her actions  

Wants to be left alone but desires companionship — despite the outcome  

Actively discourages DIVIDE from sending new partners  

Only allows female personnel near her enclosure  

Does not resist containment or supervision  

**Containment Protocol**  
LD-026 currently resides in a custom-built remote home within a secured forest compound.  

Only Level 3+ female researchers are allowed contact  

No male staff permitted within 2km radius  

Surveillance is conducted remotely, and food is auto-delivered  

All communication is logged, monitored, and reviewed bi-weekly  

No attempts at termination or relocation will be made unless LD-026 becomes hostile without cause.  

A permanent decision on her future is under internal review. All current DIVIDE Level Directors have voted in favor of allowing her to live under continued observation.  

**Internal Note**  

“She’s not a monster. Just heartbreak made into flesh.”
