**File: LD-020 — “The Finder’s Shard”**  
**Designation**: Visual Augmentation / Psychic Locator  
**Threat Level**: Class I  
**Containment Status**: Secured Artifact Storage (Vault #07)  
**Clearance Level**: DIVIDE Level 2+  









LD-020 Photo Reference “Object displayed on retrieval table — note anomalous refraction in surrounding light.”  

**Description**  
LD-020 is a jagged, glass-like shard roughly 15 cm in length. It emits a faint, cool glow when held and appears to refract light unnaturally, causing subtle visual distortion around its edges. Despite its fragile appearance, LD-020 is completely indestructible—resistant to all known forms of physical, thermal, and chemical damage.  

When grasped by a living human subject, LD-020 activates, allowing the user to visually perceive the location of any object, entity, or individual they consciously wish to find within a 100-meter radius. The shard’s effect generates transparent overlays or “ghost images” of the sought subject through walls, floors, and barriers, visible only to the holder.  

However, the object’s ability is psychically dependent: the user must possess a clear mental concept or familiarity with what they wish to locate. Objects never previously encountered or fully imagined cannot be visualized. LD-020 is limited by range, and cannot bypass certain materials such as dense lead shielding or high-level anti-visual anomalies.  

**Behavioral Traits**  
Emits faint blue luminescence when held  

Reacts only to organic, conscious human touch  

Overlays are visible to the user only, and appear slightly flickering or unstable  

Prolonged use leads to side effects:  

Blurred vision, bloodshot eyes  

Auditory hallucinations  

“Afterburn” effect — ghost images linger up to 3 hours after last use  

Headaches, paranoia, disassociation  

Some test subjects reported hearing faint whispers or feeling “followed” during post-use monitoring, though no secondary entity has been confirmed.  

**End of Exposure Effects**  
After extended or repeated usage (6+ consecutive activations), most subjects begin to experience bleeding from the eyes or nose, extreme disorientation, and emotional instability. Several users developed obsessive behaviors, continually scanning their environment even when not holding the object.

Long-term users begin to fixate on locating impossible things—dead relatives, abstract ideas, or their own past selves. These attempts result in mental breakdowns and catatonic states in 4 out of 7 long-term exposure trials.  

**Recorded Incident**  
Subject AT-2053 used LD-020 to locate a hidden journal lost in a collapsed asylum sector. Following retrieval, the subject refused to release the shard. After 9 hours of continuous use, AT-2053 reported “seeing versions of people that aren’t there anymore.” Subject collapsed shortly afterward, exhibiting temporary blindness and muttering the phrase, “Everything’s too close.”

**Containment Protocol**  
Stored in a secure glass-sealed box with non-reflective, lead-lined interior  

May only be handled for 10 minutes per day by approved DIVIDE psych-resistance personnel  

Users must be medically and psychologically cleared post-interaction  

Exposure must be logged and reviewed weekly  

Artifact must never be placed near other visually-linked anomalies  

**Internal Note**  
“Some things are lost for a reason. The shard doesn’t care what you want — only that you keep looking.”
