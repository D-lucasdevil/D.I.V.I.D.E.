**Description**  
LD-025 is a humanoid entity, approximately 1.8 meters tall, with deep red, raw-looking skin, lacking any facial features or clothing. Despite its grotesque appearance, it remains motionless and passive when directly confronted — unless provoked.  

LD-025's primary behavior is stalking a single target for exactly one month. During this period, it will:  

Remain barely visible at long distances  

Avoid populated areas or cameras  

Observe silently from afar (rooftops, tree lines, roadsides)  

Attempts to confront or harm the entity — especially with firearms or melee weapons — result in it fleeing permanently, choosing never to stalk that individual again.  

However, if the target instead shows fear, hides, or ignores its presence, LD-025 will grow bolder, eventually:  

Breaking into the victim’s residence  

Killing them violently (cause of death: severe mutilation)  

Using their blood and internal organs to coat every surface of the home  

Disappearing without trace afterward  

The smeared house often results in severe trauma to any responding cleanup crew or family members.  

**Behavioral Traits**  
Selects victims at random, then stalks nonstop for 30 days  

Flees permanently if shot, attacked, or directly resisted  

Becomes more aggressive the more fear is shown  

Capable of extreme violence if unchallenged  

Does not communicate, reason, or respond to emotional appeals  

Appears to have no higher intelligence beyond primal predatory instinct  

**Containment Protocol**  
Due to its nomadic, uncontained nature, LD-025 cannot be secured in a facility.  

Current action by the DIVIDE Foundation:  

Live capture deemed unnecessary  

Immediate termination approved by Task Force 3-Delta ("Red Watch")  

Survivors of stalking events are advised to retaliate with lethal force immediately  

No further research is planned as LD-025 has no replicable anomaly, no profitable byproduct, and poses a high civilian risk.  

**Internal Note**  

“It’s not hunting because it’s smart. It’s hunting because it knows fear keeps the meat soft.”
