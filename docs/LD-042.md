***File: LD-042***  
**Codename: “The Earth Devourers”**  
**Classification: Planetary-Scale Biological Anomaly / Megafauna**  
**Threat Level: Class IV (High-Risk Tier)**  
**Clearance Required: DIVIDE Level 4+**  






**Containment Status:**  
Uncontained — Population Regulated  

**Overview**  

LD-042 designates a species of colossal annelid-like organisms inhabiting extreme planetary environments, including deserts, polar ice caps, oceanic ice shelves, and deep subterranean strata.
These entities are among the largest biological lifeforms ever recorded and appear to play a systemic role in planetary equilibrium.  

**Physical Characteristics**  

Average Adult Length: 500–1,000 meters  
Elder Specimens: Up to 12 kilometers  
Birth Length: ~3 meters  
Growth Rate: Extremely rapid during the first decade of life  
Estimated Lifespan: 1,000–1,200 years  

Upon death, LD-042 bodies undergo accelerated decomposition, redistributing massive quantities of biomass and minerals into the surrounding environment. This process frequently results in permanent geological restructuring, including fault realignment and terrain uplift.  

**Sexual Dimorphism**  
**Female Specimens**  

Rounded cranial structure  

Continuous ring of rotating internal dentition extending from oral cavity through the digestive tract  

Dentition functions as a high-pressure grinding system capable of pulverizing rock, reinforced steel, ore deposits, and engineered structures  

Primary habitats: deserts, arid plains, deep continental interiors  

**Male Specimens** 

Hardened, spear-shaped cranial structure used for tunneling, territorial combat, and mating dominance  

No external dentition; teeth begin deep within the throat  

Capable of impaling bedrock, glaciers, and rival specimens  

Primary habitats: polar regions, ice fields, deep subglacial layers  

Both sexes have been observed crossing habitat boundaries when environmental conditions permit.  

**Behavior & Feeding**  

LD-042 organisms are non-aggressive toward humans and artificial structures unless:

Directly attacked  

Disturbed during feeding  

Interrupted during mating cycles  

Feeding occurs once per standard year, typically between late December and early January. During this period, an individual specimen may consume in excess of 50 tons of combined geological, biological, and artificial matter. 

Elder specimens, when fully extended, possess oral apertures capable of engulfing an estimated 50,000–400,000 humans simultaneously.  
No confirmed urban-scale ingestion event has occurred.  

Confirmed civilian fatalities: 23  
(Low casualty count attributed to early-warning seismic detection systems and enforced global exclusion zones.)  

**Reproduction & Population Control**  

Female specimens produce 1–3 offspring every ~50 years  

Juvenile mortality is high  

Natural population equilibrium stabilizes at 2–4 total specimens globally  

Population increase beyond this threshold has historically resulted in planetary instability.  

**Combat & Neutralization**  

LD-042 entities are exceptionally resistant to conventional military action.  

**Ineffective against:**  

Small arms  

Heavy artillery  

Missile strikes  

Sustained bombardment  

**Confirmed effective method:**  

2–3 direct nuclear warhead detonations per adult specimen  

Due to catastrophic collateral impact, nuclear termination is classified as an absolute last-resort measure.  

**Military Engagement Record:**  

1 adult male specimen neutralized  

6 of 26 Berserk Squad operatives killed  

16,877 conventional personnel lost  

Containment & Regulation Policy  

**LD-042 specimens are to remain undisturbed unless one or more of the following conditions are met:**  

Global population exceeds four  

Civilian casualties increase significantly  

Major urban zones fall within projected feeding vectors  

All termination actions require DIVIDE High Command authorization.  

**Strategic Limitation Notice:**  
Projected geopolitical tolerance permits termination of no more than two adult specimens without destabilizing global nuclear equilibrium.  

Secondary Exploitation  

**Dermal Plating:**  

Extremely resistant to thermal extremes  

Currently utilized in naval hull reinforcement and heavy armor systems  

**Biological Tissue:**  

Deemed safe for human consumption  

Classified as nutrient-dense and highly palatable  

**Associated Phenomena**  

A decentralized human cult has emerged, centered on LD-042 entities.  
Members believe the worms represent planetary enlightenment through surrender.  

**Observed behaviors include:**  

Ritual sacrifice of leadership figures upon achieving “enlightenment”  

Active obstruction of civilian evacuation during feeding cycles  
 
Ongoing monitoring is in effect.  

**Research Directive**

One juvenile LD-042 specimen has been approved for off-world relocation to Mars for long-term study of planetary adaptation and ecosystem interaction.  

Long-term termination viability: Unknown.  

**Internal Memorandum**  

“They are not monsters.  
They are the planet’s immune system.”
