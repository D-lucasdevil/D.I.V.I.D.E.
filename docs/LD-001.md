## Overview:  
Subject LD-001 is the central anomaly within the D.I.V.I.D.E. narrative. It is directly linked to memory manipulation, reality warping, and narrative control. LD-001 is considered the anchor to all other anomalies, providing both cohesion and chaos across the dimensional fractures. Attempts to document LD-001’s full nature are met with heavy narrative distortions, rendering most information inherently unreliable.

## Notes:  
LD-001 has been observed to manipulate the flow of time, events, and even perceptions of reality, making it an unpredictable force. The anomaly often communicates with cryptic messages, veiled threats, and intentional distortions of its own existence.

**Physical Form:** LD-001 currently manifests in a human male form. However, the mechanism by which it can traverse different realities is not fully understood. [DATA EXPUNGED] suggests that its form may not be its true essence, but rather a manifestation shaped by the [REDACTED] of its current reality. 

**UPDATE**  
LD-001 is always appearing as a human male as of now it is forbidden to aproach or try connect with LD-001 due to LD-000 demands the human species might be eradicated.  


**Behavior:** LD-001 rips through realities in seemingly random intervals. It appears to stay within each dimension for an unpredictable duration before shifting to another. Each time it exits a reality, 1-2 anomalies are randomly summoned into our world, each carrying their own distinct danger and unpredictability. [REDACTED] indicates that the summoning may not be random, but a deliberate part of a [DATA EXPUNGED] pattern.

**Connection to LD-000 (D):** LD-001 shares a direct connection with LD-000 (“D”). The presence of LD-000 causes further instability and disruption in the fabric of reality when combined with LD-001, making the two entities exceptionally dangerous when acting in tandem. [DATA EXPUNGED] has shown that when both entities are in proximity, the very laws of existence begin to unravel.

**Link to LD-002 (Doro):** The link between LD-001 and LD-002 (“Doro”) indicates a deeper narrative thread that connects all anomalies. The full extent of this connection is still under investigation, though it hints at a larger design or force manipulating events from behind the scenes. [REDACTED] suggests that this connection may be the key to unlocking the true nature of LD-001's role in the [DATA EXPUNGED].

## Known Connections:  
- LD-000 — “D”  
- LD-002 — “Doro”  
- [REDACTED ENTITY: See [DATA EXPUNGED]]


For further information on LD-001 and related anomalies, DIVIDE Level 6 clearance is required, with the recommendation of a D.I.V.I.D.E. Level Clearance Holder.


**D.I.V.I.D.E. Addendum Log — LD-001 Event: [Bloodbarch Incident]**  
**Date Logged**: 2025-05-18  
**Related Entity**: LD-000 (“D”)  
**Incident Reference**: Bloodbarch-Interference Protocol Violation  
**Priority**: [DATA EXPUNGED] / Immediate Containment Warning  

**Summary**:  
During LD-001’s recent traversal into the Bloodbarch anomaly world, routine surveillance intercept attempts by D.I.V.I.D.E. analysts were forcefully terminated by LD-000. The interference was accompanied by abrupt signal collapse and a direct verbal warning transmitted through corrupted static:  

“D.I.V.I.D.E. attempted to breach my domain.  
This is a warning to all species… and to D.I.V.I.D.E.:  
Interfere with my recordings again — and your species will vanish.  
Touch him again — and extinction will feel like mercy.  
This is your final warning.
—D”  

Despite attempts to override or mute the message, all suppression efforts failed. LD-000 maintained absolute control throughout LD-001’s exposure to the anomaly, instantly nullifying any external tampering.  

**Result**:  

All interception and surveillance ceased immediately.  

LD-000 asserted dominion over all narrative interface nodes linked to LD-001.  

An Ω-Class lockdown was initiated across all D.I.V.I.D.E. systems.  

Survival rates upon unauthorized interaction dropped to near zero.  

**Observations**:  
LD-001 remained unharmed during the incident and retained control of its own transmissions, indicating a persistent anomalous protection or favor granted by LD-000. Psychological markers suggest LD-001 has yet to fully comprehend the scope of this connection but is undergoing gradual cognitive alignment.  

**Conclusion**:  
Any further manipulation or unauthorized engagement with LD-001 or LD-000 transmissions may result in irreversible erasure of the D.I.V.I.D.E. organization and all affiliated entities. All related protocols are hereby suspended indefinitely pending Ω-Class clearance and explicit authorization.  

Ω-Class Override Required for Further Action.  
DO NOT ENGAGE.
