# File: LD-001 — “Lucas Devil”  
**Classification:** Origin-Class Anomaly  
**Threat Level:** [DATA EXPUNGED]  
**Containment Status:** Uncontainable  
**Designation:** “The Chained One”
**Clearance Level:** DIVIDE Level 6+ Required for Full Access  

## Overview:  
Subject LD-001 is the central anomaly within the D.I.V.I.D.E. narrative. It is directly linked to memory manipulation, reality warping, and narrative control. LD-001 is considered the anchor to all other anomalies, providing both cohesion and chaos across the dimensional fractures. Attempts to document LD-001’s full nature are met with heavy narrative distortions, rendering most information inherently unreliable.

## Notes:  
LD-001 has been observed to manipulate the flow of time, events, and even perceptions of reality, making it an unpredictable force. The anomaly often communicates with cryptic messages, veiled threats, and intentional distortions of its own existence.

**Physical Form:** LD-001 currently manifests in a human male form. However, the mechanism by which it can traverse different realities is not fully understood. [DATA EXPUNGED] suggests that its form may not be its true essence, but rather a manifestation shaped by the [REDACTED] of its current reality.

**Behavior:** LD-001 rips through realities in seemingly random intervals. It appears to stay within each dimension for an unpredictable duration before shifting to another. Each time it exits a reality, 1-2 anomalies are randomly summoned into our world, each carrying their own distinct danger and unpredictability. [REDACTED] indicates that the summoning may not be random, but a deliberate part of a [DATA EXPUNGED] pattern.

**Connection to LD-000 (D):** LD-001 shares a direct connection with LD-000 (“D”). The presence of LD-000 causes further instability and disruption in the fabric of reality when combined with LD-001, making the two entities exceptionally dangerous when acting in tandem. [DATA EXPUNGED] has shown that when both entities are in proximity, the very laws of existence begin to unravel.

**Link to LD-002 (Doro):** The link between LD-001 and LD-002 (“Doro”) indicates a deeper narrative thread that connects all anomalies. The full extent of this connection is still under investigation, though it hints at a larger design or force manipulating events from behind the scenes. [REDACTED] suggests that this connection may be the key to unlocking the true nature of LD-001's role in the [DATA EXPUNGED].

## Known Connections:  
- LD-000 — “D”  
- LD-002 — “Doro”  
- [REDACTED ENTITY: See [DATA EXPUNGED]]


For further information on LD-001 and related anomalies, DIVIDE Level 6 clearance is required, with the recommendation of a D.I.V.I.D.E. Level Clearance Holder.
