## File: LD-001 — "Lucas Devil"
**Classification:** Origin-Class Anomaly  
**Threat Level:** [DATA EXPUNGED]  
**Containment Status:** Uncontainable  
**Designation:** “The Chained One”

### **Overview:**  
Subject **LD-001** is the central anomaly within the D.I.V.I.D.E. narrative. It is directly linked to memory manipulation, reality warping, and narrative control. **LD-001** is considered the anchor to all other anomalies, providing both cohesion and chaos across the dimensional fractures. Attempts to document **LD-001**'s full nature are met with heavy narrative distortions, rendering most information inherently unreliable.

### **Notes:**  
**LD-001** has been observed to manipulate the flow of time, events, and even perceptions of reality, making it an unpredictable force. The anomaly often communicates with cryptic messages, veiled threats, and intentional distortions of its own existence.

- **Physical Form:** LD-001 currently manifests in a human male form. However, the mechanism by which it can traverse different realities is not fully understood.

- **Behavior:** **LD-001** rips through realities in seemingly random intervals. It appears to stay within each dimension for an unpredictable duration before shifting to another. Each time it exits a reality, 1-2 anomalies are randomly summoned into our world, each carrying their own distinct danger and unpredictability.

- **Connection to LD-000 (D):** **LD-001** shares a direct connection with **LD-000** ("D"). The presence of **LD-000** causes further instability and disruption in the fabric of reality when combined with **LD-001**, making the two entities exceptionally dangerous when acting in tandem.

- **Link to LD-002 (Doro):** The link between **LD-001** and **LD-002** ("Doro") indicates a deeper narrative thread that connects all anomalies. The full extent of this connection is still under investigation, though it hints at a larger design or force manipulating events from behind the scenes.

### **Known Connections:**  
- **LD-000** — “D”  
- **LD-002** — “Doro”  
- [REDACTED ENTITY: See [DATA EXPUNGED]]

### **Project:** [NARRATIVE CHAOS THEORY]
